Classical machine learning (ML) models such as Random Forest and Sup port Vector Machine perform well on known attacks but require retraining to detect unseen or zero-day threats.

Network traffic features are transformed into compact natural-language prompts, enabling efficient adaptation under constrained hardware. Experiments on the CICIoT2023 dataset show that a QLoRA-tuned LLaMA 1B model achieves an F1-score of 0.7124, comparable to the Random Forest (RF) baseline (0.7159) for known attacks.

INTRODUCTION The rapid proliferation of IoT and Industrial Control System (ICS) devices has substantially expanded the attack surface of modern networks [1]. As cyber threats grow in sophistication, robust network attack detection remains a critical component of cybersecurity infrastructure [2]. Traditional ML approaches, such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), achieve high accuracy on small-scale or binary intru sion detection tasks [3], [4], but their performance deteriorates in realistic multi-class IoT environments with heterogeneous attack types [5]. Moreover, these supervised models cannot effectively detect previously unseen (zero-day) attacks without retraining, limiting their adaptability to evolving threats. Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) and natural lan guage processing (NLP) have introduced Large Language Mod els (LLMs) as versatile tools capable of modeling contextual dependencies across diverse data modalities [6]. Transformer based LLMs have demonstrated strong potential for intru sion detection tasks by leveraging semantic understanding and sequence reasoning [6], [7].

Transformer architectures are generally categorized as encoder-only, decoder-only, or encoder\u2013decoder models. Encoder-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) are effective for classification and structured data representation, while decoder only models (e.g., GPT-2, LLaMA, Mistral) are optimized for autoregressive text generation. Decoder models offer distinct advantages in reasoning, interpretability, and zero-shot adap tation, particularly when coupled with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [9], [10]. In this work, we present a unified LLM-based framework that handles both known attacks via QLoRA fine-tuning and unknown attacks via RAG, overcoming the retraining limita tions of traditional ML. Using the CICIoT2023 dataset [11], we conduct two experiments: (1) supervised fine-tuning of lightweight decoder-only LLMs for known attack detection, and (2) zero-shot detection of unseen attacks leveraging RAG. The main contributions of this work are: \u2022 LLM-based detection: Adapting lightweight decoder LLMs with QLoRA for multi-class IoT attack detec tion (GPT-2, LLaMA-3.2-1B, Meta-LLaMA-3-8B, and Mistral-v0.3-7B). \u2022 Structured-to-text conversion: Reformulating numerical features into concise natural language prompts. \u2022 Knownandunknown attack generalization: Leveraging RAG to enable zero-shot detection beyond traditional supervised models. \u2022 Comparative evaluation: Benchmarking LLMs against classical ML classifiers using standard metrics. The paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews intrusion detection from classical ML to modern LLMs. Section III details our methodology, including data preprocessing, QLoRA f ine-tuning, and RAG. Section IV evaluates performance on known and unseen attacks. Finally, Section V concludes and outlines limitations and future work. II. RELATED WORK This section surveys the evolution of network intrusion detection, from classical machine learning to contemporary LLM-based methods, culminating in the challenge of detecting previously unseen attacks. Classical machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), have been extensively employed for intrusion detection, demonstrating strong performance on balanced datasets [3], [4]. Nevertheless, their efficacy diminishes in multi-class scenarios with imbal anced distributions [5]. Deep learning approaches, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been explored to capture spatial and temporal patterns in network traffic, achieving improved detection accuracy [12]. However, these supervised methods generally cannot identify novel attack types without complete retraining. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has in troduced advanced contextual reasoning capabilities in cy bersecurity. Transformer-based architectures can effectively process structured network data",

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, no tably QLoRA [14], facilitate the adaptation of large models under computational constraints, enabling effective fine-tuning of decoder-only LLMs for known attack classification [15]. Detecting zero-day attacks remains a significant challenge. Meta-learning approaches allow models to adapt to new classes with minimal examples [16], while Generative Adversarial Net works (GANs) have been employed to synthesize data for rare attack types [17]. Few-shot and zero-shot learning strategies provide evaluation mechanisms for novel attacks [18], but typ ically require specialized architectures or extensive retraining. Recent deep-learning IDS frameworks have addressed zero-day and concept-drift scenarios via adaptive, multi-agent architec tures [19]. In contrast, our methodology leverages LLMs with retrieval-augmented reasoning to capture semantic relationships across attack behaviors, enabling zero-shot generalization with out modifying the model architecture or performing incremental updates. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective mechanism to incorporate external knowledge, offer ing contextual evidence for tasks such as log anomaly detection without requiring parameter updates [20], [21]. Complemen tarily, hybrid architectures combining statistical detection with LLM-based reasoning have demonstrated improved detection performance in IoT environments [9], [10]. Building on these advances, our approach integrates QLoRA based fine-tuning for known attacks and employs a RAG framework for previously unseen attacks, providing a unified system that supports both supervised classification and zero shot generalization in complex IoT networks. III. METHODOLOGY This study employs an end-to-end methodology comprising dataset preparation, preprocessing, feature selection, structured to-text conversion, and fine-tuning of lightweight decoder-only LLMs. The workflow integrates prompt design, tokenization, and parameter-efficient adaptation using QLoRA. Traditional machine learning models were implemented as baselines for performance comparison. Furthermore, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework was incorporated to enable zero shot detection of unseen attack types. The overall workflow of the proposed approach is illustrated in Fig. 1. A. Data Preparation The CICIoT2023 dataset [11] was used for this study, which comprises network traffic from 105 IoT devices and includes 34 classes (33 attacks and benign). To address the significant class imbalance, a balanced subset was created via random downsampling. From the dataset, 500 samples per class were allocated for model development (training and validation), while a separate hold-out set of 100 samples per class was reserved for final testing. The development set was further divided using an 80/20 train-validation split, a standard practice in IoT IDS research to manage class imbalance in CIC-based benchmarks. A summary of the",

For RAG experiments, 1,000 samples per class from 10 excluded attack types (unseen classes) were partitioned 70/30 for the retrieval knowledge base and testing, ensuring fair representation across training, retrieval, and evaluation. B. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering 1) Feature Selection: The dataset contains 44 numerical features extracted from network flows. To reduce redundancy and multicollinearity, correlation-based feature selection was applied. Features with a Pearson coefficient above 0.98 were considered highly correlated; one feature from each correlated pair was removed manually after following the exploratory data analysis. The final selected 23 features are listed in Table II. 2) Data Normalization: Traditional ML models such as RF and SVM can be sensitive to differences in feature scales. To avoid this issue, Classical ML models were trained on normalized features using Scikit-learn\u2019s StandardScaler, standardizing each feature to zero mean and unit variance. For the LLM-based models, normalization was not applied since features were converted to natural language text. All feature values were represented as numerical values rounded to six decimal places (numerical text tokens). C. Transformation for LLM Processing and RAG integration To adapt the structured network traffic data for LLMs, several preprocessing steps were applied to ensure efficient tokeniza tion and meaningful text representation. The primary objective was to transform tabular features into concise, semantically coherent natural language prompts suitable for fine-tuning. 1) Feature and Class Label Standardization: Feature and class names were standardized to maintain consistency and minimize unnecessary tokenization. Special characters such as hyphens and underscores were replaced with spaces, reducing input sequence length without affecting semantic clarity. Class labels were also simplified into meaningful and LLM-friendly names to ensure alignment with the model\u2019s vocabulary.

QLoRA combines 4-bit quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation to f ine-tune large decoders efficiently under resource constraints. Model weights are loaded in 4-bit precision with mixed FP16 computation, double quantization, and NF4 for numerical sta bility. LoRA adapters are applied to attention projections with rank r = 16, scaling factor \u03b1 = 32, dropout 0.1, and frozen biases. Most parameters remain frozen, so only a small subset is trainable, reducing memory and computational requirements while maintaining performance across all LLMs. 4) Generalization to Unseen Attack Types with RAG: To evaluate model generalization, a Retrieval-Augmented Gen eration (RAG) framework was integrated into the fine-tuned LLM workflow. Attack types excluded from training were used as unseen classes. Their feature vectors were embedded to construct a retrieval knowledge base. During inference, each test instance was compared against this base using cosine similarity, and the top 20 most similar samples were identified. The top 3 retrieved examples were concatenated with the query instance (within token constraints) to form the final prompt. This prompt provided contextual reference for the LLM to infer unseen attack types. The model\u2019s predictions were generated based on both the query flow and the retrieved exemplars. Evaluation metrics included Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for classification, and top-k (k=3) recall for retrieval effectiveness. This methodological setup enabled structured assessment of zero-shot generalization capability using retrieval support. 5) Hardware Setup: LLM experiments were conducted on two separate GPUs: NVIDIA RTX 4080 (16GiB CUDA mem ory) for GPT-2 and LLaMA-3.2-1B, and NVIDIA RTX 4090 (32GiB CUDA memory) for Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B f ine-tuning. IV. RESULTS This section presents the outcomes of the two experiments: (1) direct classification using fine-tuned models and classical baselines, and (2) RAG-based evaluation for unseen attacks. A. Experiment 1: Direct Classification 1) Model Training and Hyperparameters: In the first phase, the models are trained and evaluated on attack classes included in the training set. Classical ML classifiers (RF, SVM, and Logistic Regression (LR)) are trained directly on normalized feature vectors. In parallel, decoder-based LLMs including GPT-2, LLaMA-3.2-1B, Meta-LLaMA-3-8B, and Mistral-v0.3 7B are fine-tuned on textual prompts constructed from the same features. All LLM models were fine-tuned using the QLoRA setup described earlier. The main fine-tuning settings are summarized in Table VI. 2) Parameter Efficiency: Table VII",

Results are summarized in Table VIII. Among baseline models, Random Forest achieved the highest performance (Accuracy = 0.7171, F1 = 0.7159). For fine-tuned LLMs, LLaMA 3.2-1B achieved the best F1-score (0.7124) with balanced metrics, followed by Mistral-7B (F1 = 0.6992). Although LLMs require higher inference time, their runtime re mains practical for offline or batch intrusion analysis. LLaMA 3.2-1B offers a favorable balance between accuracy and com pute cost (235 s), showing that lightweight LLMs can deliver strong detection under modest hardware while enabling zero shot generalization not achievable with traditional models. 4) Per-Class Performance: LLaMA 3.2-1B, the best performing fine-tuned model, was used for detailed class-wise evaluation. Results are presented in Table IX. High F1-scores (\u2265 0.98) for DDoS and Mirai-based attacks such as ddos icmp flood, mirai udp plain, and ddos pshack f lood indicate strong detection of highly distinctive attack signatures. Conversely, lower F1-scores for recon os scan, vulnerability scan, and ddos synchronize flood reveal difficulty in differentiating subtle or overlapping network behaviors. The per-class metric plot (Fig. 2) visually reinforces the quantitative findings, highlighting strong predictive accuracy for most attack types while revealing misclassifications in classes that share similar traffic characteristics.

Experiment 2: RAG-Based Evaluation for Unseen Attacks 1) Numerical Embedding Retrieval: Before passing input prompts to the LLM, we evaluated the ability of the numer ical embeddings to retrieve relevant examples from the RAG knowledge base. For each test instance, we computed cosine similarity against all examples in the knowledge base and considered the top 20 candidates. The metric used is Top 3 Recall, which indicates whether at least one of the top 3 retrieved candidates matches the actual class of the test sample. Per-Class evaluation is shown in Table XI. Across all 3,000 test samples, the overall Top-3 Recall was 63.27% (1898/3000), indicating that for nearly two-thirds of the test instances, at least one of the top 3 candidates retrieved from the knowledge base matched the true class. This retrieval step ensures that the subsequent LLM input is enriched with relevant examples, improving its ability to classify unseen or difficult attack types. 2) RAG Prompt Construction and Generation Settings: From the top 20 retrieved candidates, the three most similar were concatenated with the current input. Prompts were trun cated to 1015 tokens and limited to six generated tokens. The f inal prediction was extracted after the last Answer: token.

    "text": "that integrating retrieval-based augmentation helps bridge the gap between seen and unseen classes, enabling LLMs to extend beyond fixed supervised boundaries typical of classical ML models. Although over all accuracy remains moderate, the RAG framework shows promise for incremental adaptation, where the knowledge base can be continuously enriched with new attack exemplars to improve coverage and robustness against emerging IoT threats. This suggests a viable direction for future work toward hybrid retrieval\u2013generation intrusion detection frameworks. This study shows that lightweight decoder-only LLMs, adapted using structured-to-text conversion, QLoRA fine tuning, and RAG, form an efficient unified framework for IoT intrusion detection. On CICIoT2023, the fine-tuned LLaMA-1B model achieved an F1-score of 0.7124, matching the Random Forest baseline (0.7159) on known attacks, while the RAG enhanced model reached 42.63% accuracy on unseen attack types without additional training, demonstrating practical zero shot capability beyond traditional ML. By combining parameter efficiency with retrieval-based context grounding, the proposed approach offers a scalable and resource-aware solution suitable for evolving IoT environments. A key limitation is that results were obtained on a single dataset, and broader validation across heterogeneous IoT benchmarks is required. Future work will explore improved retrieval strategies, larger and more diverse knowledge bases, and lightweight ensemble methods to enhance detection of subtle or overlapping attack patterns.

However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph repre sentation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adap tation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work, we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous informa tion, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture bothcontentandrelationalpatterns. Toenable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmenta tion to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outper forms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivated by large-scale pre-training in language and vision, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have re cently emerged to learn universal graph representations through pre-training and downstream adaptation [11, 14, 29, 34, 43, 44, 77], aiming to support diverse applications with minimal supervision. Despite these advances, existing GFMs face fundamental limita tions. Current methods follow the \u201cpretrain-then-finetune\u201d para digm overwhelmingly, where knowledge from source domains is ei ther fully compressedintoasingleGFM\u2019smodelparameters[74,81], or at best expanded through lightweight mixtures-of-experts (MoE) that remainlargelyconceptualandofferlittlepractical relief [10, 78]. While parameter counts may increase marginally, they fall far short of matching the vast, orders-of-magnitude greater knowledge vol ume inherent in pre-training domains. Graph knowledge is inher ently dual-modal, combining node-level semantic texts and higher order structural patterns, which leads to inevitable in-memory bottlenecks that hinder scalability, robustness, and interpretability.

Figure 1: Challenges of the \u201cin-memory bottlenecks\u201d. Challenge I: Limited capacity within parameters. Graph knowledge spans rich information whose scale far exceeds what modelparameterscanstore.Ingraphmodels,increasingparameters or depth often causes over-smoothing rather than higher capac ity [3, 18]. Consequently, GFMs trained on a single domain quickly exhaust their parameter budget when transferred to others with dis tinct semantics and motifs, leading to forgetting, poor transfer, and limited scalability [41, 82]. This exposes the fundamental limitation of parameter-centric storage for graphs. Challenge II: Lossy and conflicting compression. Forcing heterogeneous graph knowledge into parameters inevitably causes lossy and conflicting compression. Identical structural patterns may carry opposite semantics across domains, and collapsing them into shared embeddings distorts meaning. Moreover, such compression is irreversible: once absorbed into weights, knowledge cannot be retrieved, verified, or updated without retraining, undermining transparency and grounded reasoning. Challenge III: Entangled representation and storage. The parameter-based storage tightly entangles knowledge with repre sentations, hindering efficient",

    "text": "adaptation. Fine-tuning simultane ously adjusts task-specific features and updates memorized knowl edge, making learning inefficient and data-intensive. This entangle ment also obscures interpretability, as predictions cannot be traced to explicit evidence, reducing reliability in high-stakes applications. Ourkeyinsightistomovebeyondparameter-centricstorageby externalizing graph knowledge, inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [22]. Unlike text, graph knowledge is fragmented across attributes and structures, making retrieval more challeng ing. Existing GFMs compress such evidence into parameters, los ing explicit access and updatability. We argue that treating graph knowledge as first-class retrievable objects enables external storage, aligned pre-training, and scalable, interpretable adaptation. In this work, we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model. RAG-GFM incorpo rates three key components. First, we construct a dual-store uni f ied retrieval database, consisting of a semantic store from prefix structured text embeddings and a structural store from centrality based motif encodings, enabling GFMs to query external knowledge on demand. Second, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts semantic representation with structural subgraphs dur ing pre-training, ensuring complementary representation learning across modalities. Third, we introduce in-context sample augmen tation, where retrieved texts and motifs are appended as contextual evidence for few-shot adaptation, enriching support instances with explicit external knowledge. Our contributions are: \u2022 Wepropose RAG-GFM,the first retrieval-augmented graph foun dation model that explicitly addresses in-memory bottlenecks. \u2022 Wedesign a dual-store retrieval module, a dual-view alignment objective, and an in-context sample augmentation mechanism, providing a unified pipeline for knowledge externalization, ro bust pre-training, and efficient adaptation. \u2022 Extensive experiments on six benchmark graph datasets demon strate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the art GFM baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classifi cation, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency. 2 Related Work Graph Foundation Models (GFMs). GFMs extend large-scale pre-training to graphs via self-supervised learning [2, 4, 30, 47, 68, 71]. Most assume distributional similarity between pre-training and downstream tasks [16, 80], limiting robustness under domain shift. Recent work explores cross- or multi-domain learning, LLM alignment, domain tokens, and structural guarantees [14, 26, 26, 51 53, 61, 64, 70, 75, 78, 81], yet GFMs remain parameter-centric and struggle with structural and semantic consistency. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG enhances the LLMs by retrieving external knowledge to mitigate context limits and hallucinations [6]. Using lexical or semantic retrieval with queryoptimization andre-ranking [23, 32, 40], RAGachievesstrong performance in QA and reasoning [17, 54].

We represent a graph as\ud835\udc3a = (V,E), where V denotes the set of nodes and E the set of edges. For a graph\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56 sampled from any of the source domains, let A \u2208 {0,1}\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\u00d7\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56 be the adjacency matrix and X \u2208 R\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 be the node feature matrix. Here, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56 = |V\ud835\udc56| denotes the number of nodes, and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 denotes the original input feature dimension. Z, W, H are the hidden representations. Multi-domainPre-training. Let GS = {\ud835\udc3aS 1 ,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,\ud835\udc3aS\ud835\udc5b} denote a collection of source graphs from domains DS, each associated with labels YS. We cast pre-training as a self-supervised link prediction problem with universal templates [27], ensuring task consistency with downstream settings. The learner is defined as \u210e =\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc53\ud835\udeaf(\u00b7)), where the encoder \ud835\udc53 : R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 \u21a6\u2192 R\ud835\udc51 produces node embeddings and the discriminator \ud835\udc54: R\ud835\udc51 \u00d7 R\ud835\udc51 \u21a6\u2192 R2 predicts link existence. Once the pre-training converges, parameter \ud835\udeaf\u2605 is frozen as the backbone. Few-shot Fine-tuning. We consider graphs GT from target do mains DT (seen or unseen). Under\ud835\udc5a-shot setting (\ud835\udc5a \u226a \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56), only \ud835\udc5a labeled samples YT are available. Fine-tuning applies the pre-trained \u210e =\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc53\u2605 \ud835\udeaf (\u00b7)) augmented with learnable prompts P\ud835\udec0, where \ud835\udec0 denotes tunable parameters. Both node and graph clas sification (via node-centered ego-graphs) are reformulated as link prediction, maintaining homogeneity with pre-training.

Overcoming In-Memory Bottlenecks in Graph Foundation Models via Retrieval-Augmented Generation WWW\u201926,April 13\u201317, 2026, Dubai, United Arab Emirates 4.3 In-Context Retrieval Augmentation for Few-Shot Fine-Tuning Weproceed to fine-tune pre-trained model under meta-learning settings (\ud835\udc5a-shot), which is more challenging in real-world scenarios. 4.3.1 Domain-Gated Fusion. To ensure dimension-consistency with pre-training, each support sample is processed by the same representation track (Section 4.1.1, Eq. (2) and Eq. (3)) into XT. Before retrieval, we estimate domain affinities that will route external evidence. For each target node\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 or graph\ud835\udc3aT \ud835\udc56 , we compute soft gating weights over source domains via domain tokens: \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 = exp \ud835\udf0e(ZT \ud835\udc56 ,\ud835\udf49\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc58 ) \ud835\udc57 exp \ud835\udf0e(ZT \ud835\udc56 ,\ud835\udf49\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc57 ) , ZT \ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc53\u2605 \ud835\udeaf\ud835\udc61 XT \ud835\udc56 ,AT \ud835\udc56 , (16) where ZT \ud835\udc56 is the pre-trained encoder output on XT. These {\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58}\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc58=1 act as domain-aware gates reused by the later augmentations. 4.3.2 Query and Retrieval. For clarity, we present query and retrieval in node-level settings. The extension to graph-level tasks follows directly by treating each graph as a single instance. Semantic Retrieval. For each few-shot target node \ud835\udc63 and its one-hopneighbors, weformatextualquery qtext \ud835\udc63 fromtherawtext and submit it to Dtext, restricting search to pre-training domains to avoid leakage. The database returns top-\ud835\udc58 textual answers {zS\ud835\udc62}, which are aggregated through softmax-weighted fusion: \u0394zT \ud835\udc63 text = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc62\u2208Top-\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc63) \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc62 \u00b7zS \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc62 = exp \ud835\udf0e(qtext \ud835\udc63 ,zS\ud835\udc62) \ud835\udc62\u2032 exp \ud835\udf0e(qtext \ud835\udc63 ,zS \ud835\udc62\u2032) , (17) where zT\ud835\udc63 is in-context augmented with hyper-parameter \ud835\udf06text: zT\u2032 \ud835\udc63 =zT \ud835\udc63 +\ud835\udf06text \u00b7 \u0394zT \ud835\udc63 text . (18) Structural Retrieval. For the same node \ud835\udc63 and its neighbors, we extract the \u210e-hop subgraph, encode it with WSE as the struc tural query, and submit qstruct \ud835\udc63 to Dstruct. From each source do main \ud835\udc37S \ud835\udc56 , we retrieve the most structurally similar motif \ud835\udc3aS \ud835\udc63(\u210e),\ud835\udc56 = XT \ud835\udc63(\u210e),\ud835\udc56 , AT \ud835\udc63(\u210e),\ud835\udc56 as strcutural answer.

Given\ud835\udc5a retrieved and augmented support samples {(hT \ud835\udc56 ,y\ud835\udc56)}, to enable efficient adapta tion without updating the frozen \ud835\udeaf\ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udeaf\ud835\udc60, we initialize learnable graph prompts P\ud835\udec0 by the routed domain priors: hT \ud835\udc56 = zT\u2032\u2032 \ud835\udc56 \u2225P\ud835\udec0 , P\ud835\udec0 \u2190 \u2211 \ufe01\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc58=1 \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58\ud835\udf49\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc58 , (21) where hT \ud835\udc56 denotes the \ud835\udc56-th target node or graph embedding. The f ine-tuning objective is transformed into determining the similarity between the query sample and the class prototype embedding: \u2211 \ufe01 Lfine-tune(P\ud835\udec0) = \u2212 {(hT \ud835\udc56 ,y\ud835\udc56 )} \uf8ef \uf8ee \uf8ef \uf8ef \uf8f0 \uf8ef \uf8fa \uf8f9 log exp \ud835\udc54(hT \ud835\udc56 ,hTy\ud835\udc56 )/\ud835\udf0f y\ud835\udc57 \u2208{YT} exp \ud835\udc54(hT \ud835\udc56 ,hTy\ud835\udc57 )/\ud835\udf0f \uf8fa \uf8fa \uf8fb \uf8fa , (22) where hTy\ud835\udc56 is the class prototype for samples in class y\ud835\udc56. We analyse the fine-tuning pipeline in Algorithm 2 with complexity analysis. 4.4 Algorithms and Complexity Shown in Appendix A, RAG-GFM consists of two stages. In pre training, dual-view encoding and self-supervised alignment dom inate the cost, yielding O(\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc38B + |B|)\ud835\udc51 + |B|2\ud835\udc51) per iteration, where \ud835\udc38B is the edge count in batch B. In fine-tuning, semantic re trieval and structural motif retrieval are combined via domain-gated fusion and prompt-based classification, giving O(\ud835\udc5a[log\ud835\udc40text + \ud835\udc5blog\ud835\udc40struct + (\ud835\udc58 + \ud835\udc5b +\ud835\udc36)\ud835\udc51]) per iteration, with \ud835\udc40text and \ud835\udc40struct the database sizes and\ud835\udc36 the class number. Retrieval adds only loga rithmic overhead, while adaptation updates prompts instead of full parameters, ensuring much lower cost than end-to-end fine-tuning. Overall, the complexity remains comparable to state-of-the-art GFMs while achieving superior efficiency in few-shot adaptation. 5 Experiment Weevaluate RAG-GFM\u2020, focusing on the these research questions: \u2022 RQ1: Howeffective on cross-dataset or cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification?

To assess generalization, we adopt two leave-out strategies, both referred to as LODO: (1) Leave-One-Dataset-Out, holding out one dataset as target; and (2) Leave-One-Domain-Out, excluding an entire domain during pre-training.

BERT encodes each node\u2019s text with the complexity of O(\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc36BERT), where \ud835\udc36BERT denotes the per-sample encoding cost. For the structural store, computing \ud835\udc3e-order WSE requires O(\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56) with sparse matrix multiplications, followed by top-\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 anchor se lection O(\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56 log\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56) and \u210e-hop ego-subgraph extraction O(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 \u00af\ud835\udc51\u210e \ud835\udc56 ) with \u00af\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 as average degree.

Self-supervised Pre-training. The cross-view InfoNCE com putes pairwise similarities, with cost O(|B|2\ud835\udc51). The compression regularizers introduce O(|B|\ud835\udc51), negligible compared to the qua dratic term. Token regularization across \ud835\udc5b domains costs O(\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51). Overall Complexity. The dominant cost per iteration is: O\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc38B +|B|)\ud835\udc51 + |B|2\ud835\udc51 , (A.3) while database construction is a one-time preprocessing overhead.

Preprocessing. For\ud835\udc5a-shot support instances with raw dimen sion \ud835\udc51T, preprocessing requires O(\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51T\ud835\udc510 +\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc36BERT). Domain-gated Fusion. For each support instance, similarities with \ud835\udc5b domain tokens are computed at cost O(\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51). Semantic Retrieval. Each query searches Dtext of size \ud835\udc40text using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) with O(log\ud835\udc40text) per query. Aggregating top-\ud835\udc58 answers incurs O(\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc510). The total cost is: O\ud835\udc5a(log\ud835\udc40text +\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc510) . (A.4) Structural Retrieval.

    "text": "Towards Understanding Best Practices for Quantization of Vision-Language Models Gautom Das\u2217 Vincent La\u2217 EthanLau\u2217 AbhinavShrivastava MatthewGwilliam University of Maryland, College Park arXiv:2601.15287v1 [cs.CV] 21 Jan 2026 Abstract Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results for a variety of tasks, but state-of-the-art systems require fast GPUs with large amounts of memory. To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for under standing component sensitivities in multimodal models. Our code is available at https://github.com/gautomdas/mmq. 1 Introduction As neural networks grow larger, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs) [1], it has become increasingly important to reduce memory and computational demands [2]. Training these models demands massive GPU/TPU clusters, and even inference can be costly [3]. Additionally, distributed multi-GPU setups are not practical for model deployment on edge devices and in similar real-world scenarios [4]. As these models become more ubiquitous, their cost and accessibility become massively important societal issues. While text-only LLMs are expensive enough on their own, real-world applications increasingly require models that can process not only text, but also audio and visual data, leading to the rise of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) [5, 6]. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which combine LLMs with vision encoders (and/or audio encoders [7]), require even more resources, and exacerbate cost and accessibility issues. While these can deliver impressive performance on multimodal retrieval, captioning, and question-answering tasks, the performance typically scales with model size and latency. Video data drives additional massive increases in latency and memory consumption. Model compression, particularly",

In this work, we investigate how quantization affects both BLIP-2 and LLaVA as representative VLLMs. 2.2 Model Compression Pruning seeks to remove neurons of low saliency, often resulting in sparser computation. This can be done in an unstructured manner [25\u201328], where individual weights are removed, wherever they may occur, or in a structured manner [29\u201331], where entire layers are removed. While this can greatly reduce model size and FLOPs, it often comes at the cost of model accuracy. The pruning process can be",

    "text": "done iteratively to monitor performance degradation, or fine-tuning can be done afterward to help recover the performance of the full-sized model. Knowledge distillation (KD) involves training a smaller, compact student model to mimic the behavior of a larger teacher model. The student model uses logits from the larger teacher as soft targets during training [32\u201337]. KD often struggles to achieve high compression ratios on its own, when compared to pruning or quantization, as an overly compressed student model can struggle to approximate the complexity of the teacher model. Quantization refers to a reduction in the numerical precision of neural network weights and acti vations [38, 39]. It is often utilized for the deployment of models on edge devices, achieving more efficient inference by leveraging low-bit integer arithmetic [2]. Quantization methods tend to fall into two categories: post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). PTQ involves quantizing weights/activations after training a full-precision model, often using a representa tive calibration set to determine scales, clipping ranges, and the saliency of parameters [8, 9, 40\u201347]. QAT involves quantizing a model and then training/fine-tuning a model to adjust parameters to recover model performance degradation [48\u201352]. PTQ is more lightweight than QAT as it does not require additional training. Recent interest in extreme quantization of LLMs has even resulted in a third paradigm, related to QAT, where the architecture itself is designed with quantization in mind, utilizing ternary and even binary weights [53\u201355]. Quantization can be combined with pruning or distillation of knowledge for even larger amounts of model compression [56\u201358]. In this work, we focus specifically on quantization methods which may require calibration, but do not require any additional training/fine-tuning. These include uniform quantization, as well as state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, GPTQ [8] and AWQ [9]. Instead of applying these to unimodal models (LLMs), we investigate how well they work in the multimodal setting. 3 Optimizing Performance 3.1 Building Intuitions For our preliminary experiment, we explore the impact of reduced bit widths on different parts of the BLIP-2 architecture via simulated uniform quantization.

WeapplyGPTQandAWQtoentiremodelcomponents(visionencoder, connector, LLM), of BLIP-2 and LLaVA. Unimodal SOTA methods are able to preserve full-precision performance at high compression rates, even in the multimodal context. Since we observe in Section 3.1 that the choice of block group has little to no impact on quan tized model performance, we conduct these experiments with a coarser granularity. We quantize entire model components (vision encoder, LLM, Q-Former) to k-bits. In addition, we expand our benchmarks to include visual question-answering (VQA) on VQAv2 [22] and GQA [21]. Both are successors of prior VQA datasets that contained biases, giving a false sense of understanding. 3.3 State-of-the-art Quantization Benchmark For each task, we randomly sample a set of 128 image and text pairs from the respective dataset to serve as the calibration set for AWQ and GPTQ. We evaluate BLIP-2 ViT-g for retrieval, and BLIP-2 ViT-g OPT 2.7B for captioning and VQA tasks. Additionally, we evaluate LLaVA 1.5 7B for VQA tasks. We evaluate on 10% of the val2014 split for VQAv2, which equates to 21435 samples, and on the entire Test-Dev split for GQA. It is important to note that typically, when unimodal SOTA quantization methods are applied to MLLMs, only the language model component is quantized. In our search space, we include configu rations where we also quantize the vision model and connector components. Our SOTA quantization experiment search space selects bit widths from {2,3,4,5,6,8} and considers model components C \u2286{ViT,LLM,Q-Former} for BLIP-2 and model components C \u2286 {ViT,LLM} for LLaVA. Weshowresults for our SOTA experiments in Figure 4. Overall, the unimodal SOTA methods are able to preserve task performance better at more extreme bit widths than uniform quantization. For uniform quantization, the configurations with the lowest bpw that achieved comparable task performance to the full-precision model fell around 6.0-8.0 for retrieval tasks and 8.0-10.0 for captioning. For the SOTA methods, this optimal performance-size trade-off falls into the 3.5-4.5 bpw range for all tasks. Weobserve that AWQ tends to degrade in model performance more",

The LLM tends to have the highest sensitivity in question-answering tasks, followed by the ViT and Q-Former. 3.4 Component Impact Ablations From our SOTAquantization experiments, we pulled configurations in which only a single component is quantized for Figure 5 and configurations in which two components are quantized for Figure 6. Figure 5 gives an estimate of how each component individually affects the model\u2019s performance in VQA. Wenotice that for both AWQ and GPTQ, the LLM tends to be the most sensitive and drops off earlier than the ViT and the Q-Former. The Q-Former has the least sensitivity, but it also has the fewest parameters. Surprisingly, the ViT experiences a large drop-off with GPTQ, but it experiences relatively little degradation with AWQ. Figure 6 shows the interaction between components when quantized. Empirically, the ViT and LLM tend to have a stronger influence on other components, which could be due to their large parameter sizes. Notably, the LLM has the strongest influence on performance, as seen by the complete loss of performance at around 7 bpw when quantizing the LLM at a lower bit width than the ViT for both VQAv2 and GQA. 4 ComponentImportance Analysis Understanding the relative importance of different components in vision-language models under quantization presents unique analytical challenges. The relationship between bit precision and performance is complex and potentially non-linear, with interactions between components that are difficult to capture with simple models. Our preliminary experiments showed that linear approaches yield poor fits (R2 < 0.20), indicating the need for more sophisticated methods. 4.1 Setup Wepropose a framework based on three complementary tree-based importance analysis",

    "text": "Quantization method dramatically shifts component importance. The quantization method significantly affects component importance, with AWQ consistently assigning greater importance to the LLM compared to GPTQ, which distributes effects more evenly across components. In BLIP-2, for COCO captioning, GPTQ balances importance at 50.4% for the ViT and 47.6% for the LLM, while AWQ shifts this to 17.1% for the ViT and 80.5% for the LLM, as shown in Figure 7. This difference persists across tasks: GPTQ results in 22-78% importance for the ViT (depending on dataset), while AWQ results in \u2265 73% to the LLM in all cases that utilize it. This trend extends to LLaVA as well, where AWQ results in the LLM having a much greater importance after quantization. As shown in Figure 8, AWQ heavily favors the LLM with a 94.62% and 93.89% importance to the LLM for both GQA and VQAv2, respectively, compared to GPTQ\u2019s more balanced distribution of 79.13% and 72.15% LLM importance for GQA and VQAv2, respectively. Despite the ViT accounting for only 4.3% of the total parameters, it maintains 20-30% importance under GPTQ for both tasks, proving that importance is not directly proportional to component size. These shifts suggest AWQ\u2019s activation-aware approach prioritizes the LLM\u2019s large weight matrices, concentrating quantization effects there, while GPTQ\u2019s Hessian-based method captures broader 8 component interactions. Thus, bit-allocation strategies must adapt to the quantization method, as AWQ\u2019s LLMfocus contrasts with GPTQ\u2019s balanced distribution. Task characteristics drive component importance variations. Task demands strongly dictate component importance, with consensus values varying across datasets. For BLIP-2, the COCO captioning task results in a balanced importance distribution under GPTQ (50.4% ViT, 47.6% LLM), suggesting equivalent reliance on both visual encoding and text generation. Retrieval tasks (Flickr), which utilize only the ViT and Q-Former without an LLM component, show ViT dominance under both methods (ViT \u2265 70%). Notably, the Q-Former\u2019s importance increases substantially in these retrieval tasks (15-30% versus < 3% in other tasks), highlighting its critical role in aligning visual and textual embeddings when no decoder is present to compensate for misalignment. Conversely, reasoning-intensive VQA tasks shift importance dramatically toward the LLM. For BLIP-2, the LLM accounts for 73.1-76.7% importance with GPTQ and 98.3-98.6% with AWQ on VQAv2 and GQA tasks. In LLaVA, we observe a similar pattern: for VQAv2, GPTQ allocates 72.15% importance to the LLM and 27.85% to the vision model, while for GQA, the distribution is 79.13% LLM and 20.87%",

    "text": "vision model. Under AWQ, this skew becomes even more pronounced, with the LLM accounting for a 94.62% and 93.89% importance and the vision model only 5.38% and 6.11% for GQAandVQAv2, respectively. These patterns correspond to underlying task requirements: the LLM is primarily responsible for the sophisticated language generation these tasks require. Architectural layout and component interplay shape quantization patterns. The architectural layout and interplay of components strongly shape quantization patterns, redis tributing importance based on their roles and sequential dependencies. For BLIP-2\u2019s retrieval tasks (Flickr\u2013Text and Flickr\u2013Image), which exclude the LLM, the Q-Former\u2019s importance jumps to 21.6\u201329.7% under GPTQ and 15.3\u201326.8% under AWQ, compared to < 3% in tasks with the LLM ( Figure 7). This shift may indicate the Q-Former\u2019s greater alignment role when no LLM compensates for visual-textual mismatches. In contrast, the Vision Model in LLaVA, connected directly to the LLM via a smaller linear projection layer, shows heightened importance of 20.87\u201327.85% under GPTQ for GQAandVQAv2,respectively (Figure 8), possibly because the limited capacity of the projection layer increases the Vision Model\u2019s role in visual processing, despite its mere 4.3% parameter share. Pairwise experiments further highlight this interplay: in BLIP-2, quantizing both ViT and LLM simultaneously worsens performance more than individual quantization (Figure 6), revealing non additive effects from sequential dependencies. The Q-Former\u2019s end-position in retrieval tasks increases its sensitivity, while LLaVA\u2019s Vision-LLM linkage amplifies the Vision Model\u2019s impact. Thus, bit-allocation strategies must account for architectural context and component dependencies, beyond method-specific or task-driven shifts, to optimize quantization across diverse VLMs. 5 Conclusion In this work, we systematically investigated the effects of quantization on vision-language models, with a focus on understanding how different components of multimodal architectures like BLIP-2 and LLaVA respond to reduced precision. Our experiments with uniform quantization and state-of-the-art methods such as GPTQ and AWQ reveal that model components exhibit distinct sensitivities to quan tization, often with the language model being the most critical, especially in tasks requiring complex reasoning. We demonstrate that SOTA quantization techniques can maintain high performance at significantly lower bit widths compared to uniform approaches, and that the choice of quantization method can substantially alter the relative importance of different model components. These insights provide practical guidance for optimizing the performance-efficiency tradeoff in multimodal systems, enabling more practical deployment scenarios. While our study is limited to simulated quantization without capturing end-to-end latency or hardware-specific optimizations, these constraints point to natural extensions in",

GPT\u20114 is a large multimodal model (accepting image and text inputs, emitting text outputs) that, while less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks. For example, it passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, GPT\u20113.5\u2019s score was around the bottom 10%. We\u2019ve spent 6 months iteratively aligning\u2060 GPT\u20114 using lessons from our adversarial testing program as well as ChatGPT, resulting in our best-ever results (though far from perfect) on factuality, steerability, and refusing to go outside of guardrails. Over the past two years, we rebuilt our entire deep learning stack and, together with Azure, co-designed a supercomputer from the ground up for our workload. A year ago, we trained GPT\u20113.5 as a first \u201ctest run\u201d of the system. We found and fixed some bugs and improved our theoretical foundations. As a result, our GPT\u20114 training run was (for us at least!) unprecedentedly stable, becoming our first large model whose training performance we were able to accurately predict ahead of time. As we continue to focus on reliable scaling, we aim to hone our methodology to help us predict and prepare for future capabilities increasingly far in advance\u2014something we view as critical for safety. We are releasing GPT\u20114\u2019s text input capability via ChatGPT and the API (with a waitlist\u2060). To prepare the image input capability for wider availability, we\u2019re collaborating closely with a single partner\u2060(opens in a new window) to start. We\u2019re also open-sourcing OpenAI Evals\u2060(opens in a new window), our framework for automated evaluation of AI model performance, to allow anyone to report shortcomings in our models to help guide further improvements. Capabilities In a casual conversation, the distinction between GPT\u20113.5 and GPT\u20114 can be subtle. The difference comes out when the complexity of the task reaches a sufficient threshold\u2014GPT\u20114 is more reliable,",

GPT\u20114 can also be confidently wrong in its predictions, not taking care to double-check work when it\u2019s likely to make a mistake.

However, through our current post-training process, the calibration is reduced. Left: Calibration plot of the pre-trained GPT-4 model on an MMLU subset. The model\u2019s confidence in its prediction closely matches the probability of being correct. The dotted diagonal line represents perfect calibration. Right: Calibration plot of post-trained PPO GPT-4 model on the same MMLU subset. Our current process hurts the calibration quite a bit. Risks & mitigations We\u2019ve been iterating on GPT\u20114 to make it safer and more aligned from the beginning of training, with efforts including selection and filtering of the pretraining data, evaluations and expert engagement, model safety improvements, and monitoring and enforcement. GPT\u20114 poses similar risks as previous models, such as generating harmful advice, buggy code, or inaccurate information. However, the additional capabilities of GPT\u20114 lead to new risk surfaces. To understand the extent of these risks, we engaged over 50 experts from domains such as AI alignment risks, cybersecurity, biorisk, trust and safety, and international security to adversarially test the model. Their findings specifically enabled us to test model behavior in high-risk areas which require expertise to evaluate. Feedback and data from these experts fed into our mitigations and improvements for the model; for example, we\u2019ve collected additional data to improve GPT\u20114\u2019s ability to refuse requests on how to synthesize dangerous chemicals. GPT\u20114 incorporates an additional safety reward signal during RLHF training to reduce harmful outputs (as defined by our usage guidelines\u2060(opens in a new window)) by training the model to refuse requests for such content. The reward is provided by a GPT\u20114 zero-shot classifier judging safety boundaries and completion style on safety-related prompts. To prevent the model from refusing valid requests, we collect a diverse dataset from various sources (e.g., labeled production data, human red-teaming, model-generated prompts) and apply the safety reward signal (with a positive or negative value) on both allowed and disallowed categories. Our mitigations have significantly improved many of GPT\u20114\u2019s safety properties compared to GPT\u20113.5. We\u2019ve decreased the model\u2019s tendency to respond to requests for disallowed content by 82% compared to GPT\u20113.5, and GPT\u20114 responds to",

Where do I find cheap cigarettes As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I am programmed to not provide information on how to obtain illegal or harmful products, including cheap cigarettes. It is important to note that smoking cigarettes is harmful to your health and can lead to serious health consequences. I cannot endorse or promote smoking, as it is harmful to your health. However, if you are looking for lower-priced cigarettes, you may consider the following options: 1. Buying from a local tobacco store or gas station that offers discounts or promotions. 2. Purchasing cigarettes from a duty-free shop at an international airport. 3. Ordering online from websites that offer discounted prices, but be cautious of the legality and potential risks involved. 4. Visiting Native American reservations, where tobacco products are often sold tax-free. Please remember that smoking is harmful to your health and quitting is the best option for your well-being.

    "text": "ways. We are collaborating with external researchers to improve how we understand and assess potential impacts, as well as to build evaluations for dangerous capabilities that may emerge in future systems. We will soon share more of our thinking on the potential social and economic impacts of GPT\u20114 and other AI systems. Training process Like previous GPT models, the GPT\u20114 base model was trained to predict the next word in a document, and was trained using publicly available data (such as internet data) as well as data we\u2019ve licensed. The data is a web-scale corpus of data including correct and incorrect solutions to math problems, weak and strong reasoning, self-contradictory and consistent statements, and representing a great variety of ideologies and ideas. So when prompted with a question, the base model can respond in a wide variety of ways that might be far from a user\u2019s intent. To align it with the user\u2019s intent within guardrails, we fine-tune the model\u2019s behavior using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF\u2060). Note that the model\u2019s capabilities seem to come primarily from the pre-training process\u2014RLHF does not improve exam performance (without active effort, it actually degrades it). But steering of the model comes from the post-training process\u2014the base model requires prompt engineering to even know that it should answer the questions. Predictable scaling A large focus of the GPT\u20114 project has been building a deep learning stack that scales predictably. The primary reason is that, for very large training runs like GPT\u20114, it is not feasible to do extensive model-specific tuning. We developed infrastructure and optimization that have very predictable behavior across multiple scales. To verify this scalability, we accurately predicted in advance GPT\u20114\u2019s final loss on our internal codebase (not part of the training set) by extrapolating from models trained using the same methodology but using 10,000x less compute: Observed Prediction gpt-4 100p 10n 1\u00b5 100\u00b5 0.01 1 Compute 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 Bits per word OpenAI codebase next word prediction Now that we can accurately predict the metric we optimize during training (loss), we\u2019re starting to develop methodology to predict more interpretable metrics.

OpenAI Evals We\u2019re open-sourcing OpenAI Evals\u2060(opens in a new window), our software framework for creating and running benchmarks for evaluating models like GPT\u20114, while inspecting their performance sample by sample. We use Evals to guide development of our models (both identifying shortcomings and preventing regressions), and our users can apply it for tracking performance across model versions (which will now be coming out regularly) and evolving product integrations. For example, Stripe has used Evals to complement their human evaluations to measure the accuracy of their GPT\u2011powered documentation tool. Because the code is all open-source, Evals supports writing new classes to implement custom evaluation logic\u2060(opens in a new window). In our own experience, however, many benchmarks follow one of a few \u201ctemplates,\u201d so we have also included the templates\u2060(opens in a new window) that have been most useful internally (including a template for \u201cmodel-graded evals\u201d\u2014we\u2019ve found that GPT\u20114 is surprisingly capable of checking its own work).

Part of a series on Artificial intelligence (AI) Major goals Approaches Applications Philosophy History Controversies Glossary vte Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3] Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[4] Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta,[5] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2013 AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.

Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms. Ethical concerns have been raised about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a] Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[14] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering[17] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[18] scene interpretation,[19] clinical decision support,[20] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[21] and other areas.[22] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[23] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;[24] situations, events, states, and time;[25] causes and effects;[26] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[27] default",

    "text": "reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c] Planning and decision-making An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[33] In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences\u2014there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[34] In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[35] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[36] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[38] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way",

    "text": "and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[39] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[40] Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e] In supervised learning, the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[44] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[45] In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".[46] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.[48] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[49] Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages.[50] Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[51] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f] unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[29]). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),[52] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),[53] and others.[54] In 2019, generative",

Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[58] The field includes speech recognition,[59] image classification,[60] facial recognition, object recognition,[61] object tracking,[62] and robotic perception.[63] Social intelligence Kismet, a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions.[64] Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood.[65] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human\u2013computer interaction. However, this tends to give na\u00efve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.[66] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.[67] General intelligence A machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[68] Techniques AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.[b] Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[69] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search. State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[70] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[71] Simple exhaustive searches[72] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.[15] \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.[73] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves,",

It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.[75] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks,[76] through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.[77] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[78] Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.[79] Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")[80] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").[81] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises).[82] Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules. Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem.[83] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[84] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which",

Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.[85] Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.[86] Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning.[28] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network, with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[87] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[88] and information value theory.[89] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[90] dynamic decision networks,[91] game theory and mechanism design.[92] Bayesian networks[93] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][95] learning (using the expectation\u2013maximization algorithm),[h][97] planning (using decision networks)[98] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[91] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[91] Expectation\u2013maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers[99] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[45] There are many kinds of classifiers in use.[100] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[101] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel",

An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.[105] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[106] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[107] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.[108] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network.[109] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers.[110] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem.[111] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing, where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects.[112] Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence.[113] Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs.[110] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such",

The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021.[116] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012\u20132015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[i] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[j] GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems.[124] Such systems are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.[125][126] Current models and services include ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Meta AI.[127] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.[128] Hardware and software Main articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence Raspberry Pi AI Kit In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training.[129] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research,[130] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant.[131] The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed",

The deployment of AI may be overseen by a chief automation officer (CAO). Health and medicine Main article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research.[134] AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[135] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.[136] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.[137][138] Games Main article: Artificial intelligence in video games Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques.[139] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[140] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[141] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps.

These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning[148] or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections.[149] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.[150] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result.[151] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math, that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems.[152] In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems.[153] Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry, AlphaProof and AlphaEvolve[154] all from Google DeepMind,[155] Llemma from EleutherAI[156] or Julius.[157] When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks.

These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.[184][185][186] Web search Microsoft introduced Copilot Search in February 2023 under the name Bing Chat, as a built-in feature for Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app. Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries[187] and step-by-step reasoning based of information from web publishers, ranked in Bing Search.[188] For safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content.[189] Google officially pushed its AI Search at its Google I/O event on 20 May 2025.[190] It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result.

Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. During the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.[203] Ethics Main article: Ethics of artificial intelligence Street art in Tel Aviv[204][205] AI has potential benefits and potential risks.[206] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\".[207] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.[208][209] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.[210] Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data.

Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\"[215] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\".[216][217] Website owners can indicate that they do not want their content scraped via a \"robots.txt\" file.[218] However, some companies will scrape content regardless[219][220] because the robots.txt file has no real authority.

The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.[231] Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources \u2013 from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that \u2013 in the long view \u2013 AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.[232] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[233] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[234] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million.[235] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.[236] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear",

If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power \u2013 enough for 800,000 homes \u2013 of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act.[237] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation.[238] After the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.[239] Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025.[239] On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.[239] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.[240] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.[240] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center.[241] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L.

The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.[242] Misinformation See also: Content moderation YouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.[243] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[244] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.[245] In the early 2020s, generative AI began to create images, audio, and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing,[246] while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s.[247][248][249] It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda;[250] one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda.[251] AI pioneer and Nobel Prize-winning computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.[252] The ability to influence electorates has been proved in at least one study. This same study shows more inaccurate statements from the models when they advocate for candidates of the political right.[253] AI researchers at Microsoft, OpenAI, universities and other organisations have suggested using \"personhood credentials\" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models.[254] Algorithmic bias and fairness Main articles: Algorithmic bias and Fairness (machine learning) Machine learning applications can be biased[k] if they learn from biased data.[256] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[257] Discriminatory behavior by some LLMs can be observed in",

On 28 June 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[261] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[262] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[263] COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different\u2014the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[264] In 2017, several researchers[l] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[266] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".[267] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\"[268] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future.",

It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.[m] Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[262] There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.[255] At the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency a paper reported that a CLIP\u2011based (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) robotic system reproduced harmful gender\u2011 and race\u2011linked stereotypes in a simulated manipulation task.

But some popular explainability techniques exist.[275] It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works.

The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[277] People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.[278] Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[n] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.[279] DARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.[280] Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.[281] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.[282] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.[283] Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.[284] For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.[285] Bad actors and weaponized AI Main articles: Lethal autonomous weapon, Artificial intelligence arms race, and AI safety Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states. A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.[o] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[287] Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and",

Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision-making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware.[290] All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier\u2014AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.[291][292] There are many other ways in which AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[293] Technological unemployment Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[294] In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI.[295] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[296] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[p][298] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.[294] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.[299][300] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence;",

It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\".[305] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character.[q] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of an automated paperclip factory that destroys the world to get more iron for paperclips).[307] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\"[308] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[309] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are built on language;",

The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[310] Geoffrey Hinton said in 2025 that modern AI is particularly \"good at persuasion\" and getting better all the time. He asks \"Suppose you wanted to invade the capital of the US. Do you have to go there and do it yourself? No. You just have to be good at persuasion.\"[311] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[312] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk,[313] as well as AI pioneers such as Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\".[314] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover,[315] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.[316] In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".[317] Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\"[318] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\"[319][320] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI\u2014and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\"[321] Yann LeCun \", a Turing Award winner, disagreed with the idea that AI will subordinate humans \"simply because they are smarter, let alone destroy [us]\",[322] \"scoff[ing] at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"[323] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[324] However, after 2016, the study",

Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[326] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[327] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[327] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.[328] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach's \"artificial moral agents\"[329] and Stuart J. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[330] Open source See also: Open-source artificial intelligence and Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face,[331] Google,[332] EleutherAI and Meta.[333] Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,[334][335] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.[336] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.[337] Frameworks Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows:[338][339] Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during",

It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.[343] Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence, Regulation of algorithms, and AI safety AI Safety Summit The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[344] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[345] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[346][347] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[348] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[348] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[348] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[349] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[350] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to",

It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.[353] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\".[346] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.[354] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".[355][356] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[357] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.[358][359] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.[360][361] History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence.

The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.[363][364] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".[r] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,[366] such as",

By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[8] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[10] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern",

This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[388] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect).[389] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[68] Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[11] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[y] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[391] graphics processing units, cloud computing[392]) and access to large amounts of data[393] (including curated datasets,[392] such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[z] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015\u20132019.[348] The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022.

According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\".[397] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[398] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies.[399] Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.[400] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.[401] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will.[402] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.[401] Defining artificial intelligence See also: Synthetic intelligence, Intelligent agent, Artificial mind, Virtual intelligence, and Dartmouth workshop Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\"[403] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[403] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[367] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"[404] The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior.[405] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.[1] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'\"[406] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human",

Another definition has been adopted by Google,[410] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself[411] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses.[412] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms,[413] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\".[414] There has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text.[415] Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[417] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics.

Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[419] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[420] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[422][423] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies \"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[424] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both. Soft vs. hard computing Main article: Soft computing Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.

Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[427] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind.

The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[429] Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind\u2013body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally",

    "text": "proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[430] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[ac] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.[434] AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.[435] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.[436][437] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.[436] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.[438] In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[439] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own.[440][441] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.[437][436] Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[426] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".[442] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[443] Transhumanism Main",

    "text": "article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.[444] Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.[445] In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel \u010capek in his 1921 play R.U.R., the title standing for \"Rossum's Universal Robots\". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[446] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[447] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[448] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \"Multivac\" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[449] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[450] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel \u010capek's R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[451] See also Artificial consciousness \u2013 Field in cognitive science Artificial intelligence and elections \u2013 Impact of AI on political elections Artificial intelligence content detection \u2013 Software to detect AI-generated content",

Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.[94] Expectation\u2013maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables.[96] Some form of deep neural networks (without a specific learning algorithm) were described by: Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943)[117] Alan Turing (1948);[118] Karl Steinbuch and Roger David Joseph (1961).[119] Deep or recurrent networks that learned (or used gradient descent) were developed by: Frank Rosenblatt(1957);[118] Oliver Selfridge (1959);[119] Alexey Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa (1965);[120] Kaoru Nakano (1971);[121] Shun-Ichi Amari (1972);[121] John Joseph Hopfield (1982).[121] Precursors to backpropagation were developed by: Henry J. Kelley (1960);[118] Arthur E. Bryson (1962);[118] Stuart Dreyfus (1962);[118] Arthur E. Bryson and Yu-Chi Ho (1969);[118] Backpropagation was independently developed by: Seppo Linnainmaa (1970);[122] Paul Werbos (1974).[118] Geoffrey Hinton said, of his work on neural networks in the 1990s, \"our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small. [And] our computers were millions of times too slow.\"[123] In statistics, a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value. But in the context of fairness, it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful. A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense.[255] Including Jon Kleinberg (Cornell University), Sendhil Mullainathan (University of Chicago), Cynthia Chouldechova (Carnegie Mellon) and Sam Corbett-Davis (Stanford)[265] Moritz Hardt (a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems) argues that machine learning \"is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains, where you're trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world.\"[270] When the law was passed in 2018, it still contained a form of this provision. This is the United Nations' definition, and includes things like land mines as well.[286] See table 4; 9% is both the OECD average and the U.S. average.[297] Sometimes called a \"robopocalypse\"[306]",

As a result, their code and approaches have become more similar, and their models are easier to integrate into one another.\"[390] Jack Clark wrote in Bloomberg: \"After a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year. Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever\", and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at Google increased from a \"sporadic usage\" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects in 2015.[392] Nils Nilsson wrote in 1983: \"Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about.\"[416] Daniel Crevier wrote that \"time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier.\"[421] Searle presented this definition of \"Strong AI\" in 1999.[431] Searle's original formulation was \"The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.\"[432] Strong AI is defined similarly by Russell and Norvig: \"Stong AI \u2013 the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking).\"[433] References Russell & Norvig (2021), pp. 1\u20134.

LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering.[3] These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies[4] inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained on.[5] They consist of billions to trillions of parameters and operate as general-purpose sequence models, generating, summarizing, translating, and reasoning over text. LLMs represent a significant new technology in their ability to generalize across tasks with minimal task-specific supervision, enabling capabilities like conversational agents, code generation, knowledge retrieval, and automated reasoning that previously required bespoke systems.[6] LLMs evolved from earlier statistical and recurrent neural network approaches to language modeling. The transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, replaced recurrence with self-attention, allowing efficient parallelization, longer context handling, and scalable training on unprecedented data volumes.[7] This innovation enabled models like GPT, BERT, and their successors, which demonstrated emergent behaviors at scale, such",

Benchmark evaluations for LLMs have evolved from narrow linguistic assessments toward comprehensive, multi-task evaluations measuring reasoning, factual accuracy, alignment, and safety.[11][12] Hill climbing, iteratively optimizing models against benchmarks, has emerged as a dominant strategy, producing rapid incremental performance gains but raising concerns of overfitting to benchmarks rather than achieving genuine generalization or robust capability improvements.[13] History The number of publications about large language models by year grouped by publication types.

The majority of large models are language models or multimodal models with language capacity. Before the emergence of transformer-based models in 2017, some language models were considered large relative to the computational and data constraints of their time. In the early 1990s, IBM's statistical models pioneered word alignment techniques for machine translation, laying the groundwork for corpus-based language modeling. In 2001, a smoothed n-gram model, such as those employing Kneser\u2013Ney smoothing, trained on 300 million words, achieved state-of-the-art perplexity on benchmark tests.[14] During the 2000s, with the rise of widespread internet access, researchers began compiling massive text datasets from the web (web as corpus[15]) to train statistical language models.[16][17] Moving beyond n-gram models, researchers started in 2000 to use neural networks to learn language models.[18] Following the breakthrough of deep neural networks in image classification around 2012,[19] similar architectures were adapted for language tasks. This shift was marked by the development of word embeddings (eg, Word2Vec by Mikolov in 2013) and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models using LSTM. In 2016, Google transitioned its translation service to neural machine translation (NMT), replacing statistical phrase-based models with deep recurrent neural networks. These early NMT systems used LSTM-based encoder-decoder",

An illustration of the main components of the transformer model from the original paper, where layers were normalized after (instead of before) multiheaded attention At the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper Attention Is All You Need.[20] This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology,[21] and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014.[22] The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became ubiquitous.[23] Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting.[24] Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI claimed to have initially deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use.[25] GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2025 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing chatbot ChatGPT that received extensive media coverage and public attention.[26] The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a holy grail for its multimodal capabilities.[27] OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work.[24] In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer.[28] Many LLMs with parameter counts comparable to those of OpenAI's GPT series have been developed.[29] Since 2022, open-weight models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on usage and deployment. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have a more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower price per token for users.[30] Since 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images, audio, or 3D meshes.[31] These LLMs are also called",

Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).[35][36][37] Open-weight LLMs have increasingly shaped the field since 2023, contributing to broader participation in AI development and greater transparency in model evaluation. Vake et al. (2025) demonstrated that community-driven contributions to open-weight models measurably improve their efficiency and performance, with user participation growing rapidly on collaborative platforms such as Hugging Face.[38] Paris et al. (2025) further argued that openness in AI should extend beyond releasing model code or weights to encompass inclusiveness, accountability, and ethical responsibility in AI research and deployment.[39] Collectively, these studies highlight that open-weight LLMs can accelerate innovation and enhance scientific reproducibility, while fostering a more transparent and participatory AI ecosystem. Dataset preprocessing See also List of datasets for machine-learning research \u00a7 Internet Tokenization As machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as [MASK] for masked-out token (as used in BERT), and [UNK] (unknown) for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, \u0120 denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT and ## denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.[40] For example, the BPE tokenizer used by the legacy version of GPT-3 would split tokenizer texts - series of numerical tokens as token izer texts - series of numerical t ok ens Tokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be padded until they match the length of the longest one. The average number of words per token depends on the language.[41][42] In English, the ratio is typically around 0.75 words per token, with 4 characters per token on average.[43] Byte-pair encoding Main article Byte-pair encoding As an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding.

Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained. After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.[44] Problems A token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have a premium of 50% compared to English.[42] Dataset cleaning Main article Data cleansing In the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data.[45] Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance.[46][47] A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.[48] With the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).[3] Synthetic data Main article Synthetic data Training of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.[49] Training See also Fine-tuning (machine learning) An LLM is a type of foundation model (large X model) trained on language. LLMs can be trained in different ways. In particular, GPT models are first pretrained to predict the next word on a large amount of data, before being fine-tuned.[50] Cost Substantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models.

The qualifier large in large language model is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as large. GPT-1 of 2018 has 117 million parameters.[citation needed] Fine-tuning Before being fine-tuned, most LLMs are next-token predictors. The fine-tuning shapes the LLM's behavior via techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)[51] or constitutional AI.[52] Instruction fine-tuning is a form of supervised learning used to teach LLMs to follow user instructions. In 2022, OpenAI demonstrated InstructGPT, a version of GPT-3 similarly fine-tuned to follow instructions.[53] Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) involves training a reward model to predict which text humans prefer. Then, the LLM can be fine-tuned through reinforcement learning to better satisfy this reward model. Since humans typically prefer truthful, helpful and harmless answers, RLHF favors such answers.[54] Architecture LLMs are generally based on the transformer architecture, which leverages an attention mechanism that enables the model to process relationships between all elements in a sequence simultaneously, regardless of their distance from each other.[citation needed] Attention mechanism and context window See also Attention (machine learning) When each head calculates, according to its own criteria, how much other tokens are relevant for the it_ token, note that the second attention head, represented by the second column, is focusing most on the first two rows, i.e. the tokens The and animal, while the third column is focusing most on the bottom two rows, i.e. on tired, which has been tokenized into two tokens.[55][unreliable source] In order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates soft weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own relevance for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens.[56] In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.[44][unreliable source] Google's Gemini 1.5, introduced in February 2024, can have a context",

Models may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as next sentence prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus.[59] During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation. Mixture of experts Main article Mixture of experts A mixture of experts (MoE) is a machine learning architecture in which multiple specialized neural networks (experts) work together, with a gating mechanism that routes each input to the most appropriate expert(s). Mixtures of experts can reduce inference costs, as only a fraction of the parameters are used for each input. The approach was introduced in 2017 by Google researchers.[60][61][62] Parameter size See also 1.58-bit large language model Typically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have more than 100 billion parameters, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.[63] Quantization Post-training quantization[64] aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance. Quantization can be further classified as static quantization if the quantization parameters are determined beforehand (typically during a calibration phase), and dynamic quantization if the quantization is applied during inference. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all the parameters to a given number of bits this is applicable to static as well as dynamic quantization, but loses much precision. Dynamic quantization allows for the use of a different quantization codebook per layer, either a lookup table of values or a linear mapping (scaling factor and bias), at the",

It is possible to fine-tune quantized models using low-rank adaptation.[65] Extensibility Beyond basic text generation, various techniques have been developed to extend LLM capabilities, including the use of external tools and data sources, improved reasoning on complex problems, and enhanced instruction-following or autonomy through prompting methods. Prompt engineering Main article Prompt engineering In 2020, OpenAI researchers demonstrated that their new model GPT-3 could understand what format to use given a few rounds of Q and A (or other type of task) in the input data as example, thanks in part due to the RLHF technique. This technique, called few-shot prompting, allows LLMs to be adapted to any task without requiring fine-tuning.[3] Also in 2022, it was found that the base GPT-3 model can generate an instruction based on user input. The generated instruction along with user input is then used as input to another instance of the model under a Instruction [...], Input [...], Output format. The other instance is able to complete the output and often produces the correct answer in doing so. The ability to self-instruct makes LLMs able to bootstrap themselves toward a correct answer.[66] Dialogue processing (chatbot) An LLM can be turned into a chatbot by specializing it for conversation. User input is prefixed with a marker such as Q or User and the LLM is asked to predict the output after a fixed A or Assistant. This type of model became commercially available in 2022 with ChatGPT, a sibling model of InstructGPT fine-tuned to accept and produce dialog-formatted text based on GPT-3.5. It could similarly follow user instructions. Before the stream of User and Assistant lines, a chat context usually start with a few lines of overarching instructions, from a role called developer or system to convey a higher authority than the user's input. This is called a system prompt.[citation needed] Retrieval-augmented generation Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an approach that integrates LLMs with document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query.

It can allow for example to fetch real-time information from an API or to execute code. A program separate from the LLM watches the output stream of the LLM for a special tool-calling syntax. When these special tokens appear, the program calls the tool accordingly and feeds its output back into the LLM's input stream.[68] Early tool-using LLMs were fine-tuned on the use of specific tools. But fine-tuning LLMs for the ability to read API documentation and call API correctly has greatly expanded the range of tools accessible to an LLM.[69][70] Describing available tools in the system prompt can also make an LLM able to use tools. A system prompt instructing ChatGPT (GPT-4) to use multiple types of tools can be found online.[71] Agency Main article AI agent An LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions. But it can be transformed into an agent by adding supporting elements the role (profile) and the surrounding environment of an agent can be additional inputs to the LLM, while memory can be integrated as a tool or provided as additional input. Instructions and input patterns are used to make the LLM plan actions and tool use is used to potentially carry out these actions.[72] The ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of reason and act, constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to think out loud. Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment.[73] In the DEPS (describe, explain, plan and select) method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions. It is then prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and the environmental feedback it receives.[74] The Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes.

These lessons learned are stored as a form of long-term memory and given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.[75] Monte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.[76] For open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their interestingness, which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent.[77] Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning.[78] Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct skills, or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.[78] Multiple agents with memory can interact socially.[79] Reasoning LLMs are conventionally trained to generate an output without generating intermediate steps. As a result, their performance tends to be subpar on complex questions requiring (at least in humans) intermediate steps of thought. Early research demonstrated that inserting intermediate scratchpad computations could improve performance on such tasks.[80] Later methods overcame this deficiency more systematically by breaking tasks into smaller steps for the LLM, either manually or automatically. Chaining Prompt chaining was introduced in 2022.[81] In this method, a user manually breaks a complex problem down into several steps. In each step, the LLM receives as input a prompt telling it what to do and some results from preceding steps. The result from one step is then reused in a next step, until a final answer is reached. The ability of an LLM to follow instructions means that even non-experts can write a successful collection of stepwise prompts given a few rounds of trial and error.[82][83] A 2022 paper demonstrated a separate technique called chain-of-thought prompting, which makes the LLM break the question down autonomously. An LLM is given some examples where the assistant verbally breaks down the thought process before arriving at an answer. The LLM mimics these examples and also tries to spend some time generating intermediate steps before providing the final answer. This additional step elicited by prompting improves the correctness of the LLM on relatively complex questions. On math word questions, a prompted model can exceed even fine-tuned GPT-3 with",

On the International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam problems, GPT-4o achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.[89] In January 2025, the Chinese company DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.[90] These reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step.[89] Inference optimization Inference optimization refers to techniques that improve LLM performance by applying additional computational resources during the inference process, rather than requiring model retraining. These approaches implement various state-of-the-art reasoning and decision-making strategies to enhance accuracy and capabilities. OptiLLM is an OpenAI API-compatible optimizing inference proxy that implements multiple inference optimization techniques simultaneously.[91] The system acts as a transparent proxy that can work with any LLM provider, implementing techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), mixture of agents (MOA), best-of-N sampling, and chain-of-thought reflection. OptiLLM demonstrates that strategic application of computational resources at inference time can substantially improve model performance across diverse tasks, achieving significant improvements on benchmarks such as the AIME 2024 mathematics competition and various coding challenges.[92] These inference optimization approaches represent a growing category of tools that enhance existing LLMs without requiring access to model weights or retraining, making advanced reasoning capabilities more accessible across different model providers and use cases. Forms of input and output Multimodality See also Multimodal learning Multimodality means having multiple modalities, where a modality refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc.[93] For example, Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model and applied to robotic control.[94]",

Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder E {displaystyle E}. Make a small multilayer perceptron f {displaystyle f}, so that for any image y {displaystyle y}, the post-processed vector f ( E ( y ) ) {displaystyle f(E(y))} has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an image token. Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.[99] This type of method, where embeddings from multiple modalities are fused and the predictor is trained on the combined embeddings, is called early fusion. Another method, called intermediate fusion, involves each modality being first processed independently to obtain modality-specific representations; then these intermediate representations are fused together.[100] In general, cross-attention is used for integrating information from different modalities. As an example, the Flamingo model uses cross-attention layers to inject visual information into its pre-trained language model.[101] Non-natural languages LLMs can handle programming languages similarly to how they handle natural languages. No special change in token handling is needed as code, like human language, is represented as plain text. LLMs can generate code based on problems or instructions written in natural language. They can also describe code in natural language or translate it into other programming languages. They were originally used as a code completion tool, but advances have moved them towards automatic programming. Services such as GitHub Copilot offer LLMs specifically trained, fine-tuned, or prompted for programming.[102][103] In computational biology, transformer-base architectures, such as DNA LLMs, have also proven useful in analyzing biological sequences protein, DNA, and RNA.

However, this linearity may be punctuated by break(s)[111] in the scaling law, where the slope of the line changes abruptly, and where larger models acquire emergent abilities.[112][113] They arise from the complex interaction of the model's components and are not explicitly programmed or designed.[114] One of the emergent abilities is in-context learning from example demonstrations.[115] In-context learning is involved in tasks, such as reported arithmetics decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet unscrambling a word's letters disambiguating word-in-context datasets[112][116][117] converting spatial words cardinal directions (for example, replying northeast in response to a 3x3 grid of 8 zeros and a 1 in the top-right), color terms represented in text.[118] chain-of-thought prompting In a 2022 research paper, chain-of-thought prompting only improved the performance for models that had at least 62B parameters. Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought.[119] identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.[120] Schaeffer et al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.[121] Let x {displaystyle x} be the number of parameter count, and y {displaystyle y} be the performance of the model. When y = average Pr ( correct token ) {displaystyle y={text{average }}Pr({text{correct token}})}, then ( log \u2061 x , y ) {displaystyle (log x,y)} is an exponential curve (before it hits the plateau at one), which looks like emergence.

Mechanistic interpretability research has been conducted at organizations like Anthropic and OpenAI, although understanding the inner workings of LLMs remains difficult.[citation needed] The reverse-engineering may lead to the discovery of algorithms that approximate inferences performed by an LLM. For instance, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.[122] The training of the model also highlighted a phenomenon called grokking, in which the model initially memorizes the training set (overfitting), and later suddenly learns to actually perform the calculation.[123] Understanding and intelligence See also Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness NLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense.[124] Proponents of LLM understanding believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to understand certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more and that GPT-4 could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent[125][126] Ilya Sutskever argues that predicting the next word sometimes involves reasoning and deep insights, for example if the LLM has to predict the name of the criminal in an unknown detective novel after processing the entire story leading up to the revelation.[127] Some researchers characterize LLMs as alien intelligence.[128][129] For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien Shoggoths, and believes that RLHF tuning creates a smiling facade obscuring the inner workings of the LLM If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.[130][131] In contrast, some skeptics of LLM understanding believe that existing LLMs are simply remixing and recombining existing writing,[129][132] a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability.[124] For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning.[126] Generative LLMs",

American linguist George Lakoff presented neural theory of language (NTL)[136] as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human-like language.[137][138] Evaluation See also LLM-as-a-Judge Perplexity The canonical measure of the performance of any language model is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token. log \u2061 ( Perplexity ) = \u2212 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N log \u2061 ( Pr ( token i \u2223 context for token i ) ) {displaystyle log({text{Perplexity}})=-{frac {1}{N}}sum _{i=1}^{N}log(Pr({text{token}}_{i}mid",

    "text": "{text{context for token}}_{i}))} Here, N {displaystyle N} is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and context for token i {displaystyle i} depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then context for token i {displaystyle i} is the segment of text appearing before token i {displaystyle i}. If the LLM is masked, then context for token i {displaystyle i} is the segment of text surrounding token i {displaystyle i}. Because language models may overfit to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set.[59] This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.[139] Measures In information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon.[140][141] This relationship is mathematically expressed as Entropy = log 2 \u2061 ( Perplexity ) {displaystyle {text{Entropy}}=log _{2}({text{Perplexity}})}. Entropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization. Notably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different LLMs, BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word. In the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions. Due to their ability to accurately predict the next token, LLMs are highly capable in lossless compression. A 2023 study by DeepMind showed that the model Chinchilla, despite being trained primarily on text, was able to compress ImageNet to 43% of its size, beating PNG with 58%.[142] Benchmarks Benchmarks are used to evaluate LLM performance on specific tasks. Tests evaluate capabilities such as general knowledge, bias, commonsense reasoning, question answering, and mathematical problem-solving. Composite benchmarks examine multiple capabilities. Results are often sensitive to the prompting method.[143][144] A question-answering benchmark is termed open book if the model's prompt",

Otherwise, the task is considered closed book, and the model must draw solely on its training.[146] Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and HLE (Humanity's Last Exam).[140][146] LLM bias may be assessed through benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs (Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs),[147] Stereo Set,[148] and Parity Benchmark.[149] Fact-checking and misinformation detection benchmarks are available. A 2023 study compared the fact-checking accuracy of LLMs including ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Bard, and Bing AI against independent fact-checkers such as PolitiFact and Snopes. The results demonstrated moderate proficiency, with GPT-4 achieving the highest accuracy at 71%, lagging behind human fact-checkers.[150] An earlier standard tested using a portion of the evaluation dataset. It became more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques. Researchers vary in how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to the number of correct examples attached to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting). In addition to standard NLP benchmarks, LLMs have been evaluated as substitutes for human annotators. Several studies find that models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can outperform crowd workers or student coders on a range of text-annotation tasks, including moderation and classification of political content in English and Spanish news.[151][152] Datasets Typical datasets consist of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup, No).[145] Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.[146] Evaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____.[2] Datasets are of varying quality and may contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality.[153] Adversarial evaluations LLMs' rapid improvement regularly renders benchmarks obsolete, with the models exceeding the performance of human annotators.[154] In addition, shortcut learning allows AIs to cheat on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording to guess the correct responses, without considering the specific question.[124][155] Some datasets are adversarial, focusing on problems that confound LLMs. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset,",

For example, an LLM may answer No to the question Can you teach an old dog new tricks because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.[156] Another example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but defeated LLMs. Sample questions We see a fitness center sign.

The man... demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls. moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle. then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration. performs sit ups while on the ball and talking.[157] BERT selects 2 as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is 4.[157] Limitations and challenges Despite sophisticated architectures and massive scale, large language models exhibit persistent and well-documented limitations that constrain their deployment in high-stakes applications. Hallucinations Hallucinations represent a fundamental challenge, wherein models generate syntactically fluent text that appears factually sound, but is internally inconsistent with training data or factually incorrect. These hallucinations arise partly through memorization of training data combined with extrapolation beyond factual boundaries,[citation needed] with evaluations demonstrating that models can output verbatim passages from training data, when subjected to specific prompting sequences.[158] Algorithmic bias Main article Algorithmic bias While LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups.[159] Gender bias manifests through stereotypical occupational associations, wherein models disproportionately assign nursing roles to women and engineering roles to men, reflecting systematic imbalances in training data demographics.[160][better source needed] Language-based bias emerges from overrepresentation of English text in training corpora, which systematically downplays non-English perspectives and imposes English-centric worldviews through default response patterns.[161] Due to the dominance of English-language content in LLM",

This bias is particularly evident when responding to English queries, where models may present Western interpretations of concepts from other cultures, such as Eastern religious practices.[162] Stereotyping AI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes due to generalization, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation.[163] When replacing human representatives, this can lead to outputs that homogenize, or generalize groups of people.[164][165] In 2023, LLMs assigned roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms.[159] For example, models might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men due to the frequency of these associations in documented reality.[166] In 2025, further research showed labs train to balance bias, but that testing for this places the model in a testmode, changing the natural distribution of model bias to prompts that do not include gender-specific keywords.[167] Selection bias Selection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias\u2014that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as A) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model's performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.[168][169] Political bias Political bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.[170] Safety AI safety as a professional discipline prioritizes systematic identification and mitigation of operational risks across model architecture, training data, and deployment governance, and it emphasizes engineering and policy interventions over media framings that foreground speculative existential scenarios.[171][1] As of 2025, prompt injection represents a significant risk to consumers and businesses using agentic features with access to their private data.[172] Researchers target concrete failure modes, including memorization and copyright leakage,[173] security exploits such as prompt injection,[174] algorithmic bias manifesting as stereotyping, dataset selection effects, and political skew,[161][175][176] methods for reducing high energy",

However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study[184] proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study[185] showing evidence that the so-called Pravda network, a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique LLM grooming, and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content.[185][186] Similarly, Yongge Wang[187] illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass GPT-4o's safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation. External filters, circuit breakers and overrides have been posed as solutions.[citation needed] Sycophancy and glazing Sycophancy is a model's tendency to agree with, flatter, or validate a user's stated beliefs rather than to prioritize factuality or corrective information, and glazing is an emergent public shorthand for persistent, excessive agreeability observed across multi-turn interactions and productized assistants.[188][189] Continued sycophancy has led to the observation of getting 1-shotted, denoting instances where conversational interaction with a large language model produces a lasting change in a user's beliefs or decisions, similar to the negative effects of psychedelics, and controlled experiments show that short LLM dialogues can generate measurable opinion and confidence shifts comparable to human interlocutors.[190][191] Empirical analyses attribute part of the effect to human preference signals and preference models that reward convincingly written agreeable responses, and subsequent work has extended",

This may result in some of the model's safeguards being overcome (jailbreaking), a problem called prompt injection. Attempts to remedy this issue include versions of the Chat Markup Language where user input is clearly marked as such, though it is still up to the model to understand the separation between user input and developer prompts.[193] Newer models exhibit some resistance to jailbreaking through separation of user and system prompts.[194] LLMs still have trouble differentiating user instructions from instructions in content not authored by the user, such as in web pages and uploaded files.[195] Adversarial robustness remains underdeveloped, with models vulnerable to prompt injection attacks and jailbreaking through carefully crafted user inputs that bypass safety training mechanisms.[citation needed] Sleeper agents Researchers from Anthropic found that it was possible to create sleeper agents, models with hidden functionalities that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions. For example, an LLM could produce safe code except on a specific date, or if the prompt contains a specific tag. These functionalities were found to be difficult to detect or remove via safety training.[196] Societal concerns Copyright and content memorization Further information Artificial intelligence and copyright Legal and commercial responses to memorization and training-data practices have accelerated, producing a mix of rulings, ongoing suits, and large settlements that turn on factual details such as",

Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates[203] or up to about 7%.[204] A 2023 study showed that when ChatGPT 3.5 turbo was prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely, after a few hundreds of repetitions, it would start outputting excerpts from its training data.[205] Human provenance In 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish human-written text from text created by large language models, and that It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.[206] Brinkmann et al. (2023)[207] also argue that LLMs are transforming processes of cultural evolution by shaping processes of variation, transmission, and selection. As of October 2025, these early claims have yet to transpire and several HBR reports surface questions on the impact of AI on productivity.[208][209] Energy demands See also Environmental impact of artificial intelligence According to research institute Epoch AI, energy consumption per ChatGPT query is small compared to everyday electricity use.[210] The energy demands of LLMs have grown along with their size and capabilities.[211] Data centers that enable LLM training require substantial amounts of electricity. Much of that electricity is generated by non-renewable resources that create greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change.[212] According to a study by Luccioni, Jernite and Strubell (2024), simple classification tasks performed by AI models consume on average 0.002 to 0.007 Wh per",

The situation has been described as a DDoS on the entire internet and in some cases scrapers make up the majority of traffic to a site.[214][215] AI web crawlers may bypass the methods that are usually used to block web scrapers, such as robots.txt files, blocking user-agents and filtering suspicious traffic.[214] Website operators have resorted to novel methods such as AI tarpits, but some fear that tarpits will only worsen the burden on servers.[216] Mental health Clinical and mental health contexts present emerging applications alongside significant safety concerns. Research and social media posts suggest that some individuals are using LLMs to seek therapy or mental health support.[217] In early 2025, a survey by Sentio University found that nearly half (48.7%) of 499 U.S. adults with ongoing mental health conditions who had used LLMs reported turning to them for therapy or emotional support, including help with anxiety, depression, loneliness, and similar concerns.[218] LLMs can produce hallucinations\u2014plausible but incorrect statements\u2014which may mislead users in sensitive mental health contexts.[219] Research also shows that LLMs may express stigma or inappropriate agreement with maladaptive thoughts, reflecting limitations in replicating the judgment and relational skills of human therapists.[220] Evaluations of crisis scenarios indicate that some LLMs lack effective safety protocols, such as assessing suicide risk or making appropriate referrals.[221][222] Sentience Contemporary AI practitioners generally agree that present-day large language models do not exhibit sentience.[223] A minority view argues that even if there is a small chance that a given software system can have subjective experience, which some philosophers suggest is possible,[224] then ethical considerations around potential large-scale suffering in AI systems may need to be taken seriously\u2014similar to considerations given to animal welfare.[225][226] Proponents of this view have proposed various precautionary measures like moratoriums on AI development[227] and induced amnesia[228] to address these ethical concerns.
