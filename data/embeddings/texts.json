INTRODUCTION\nThe rapid proliferation of IoT and Industrial Control System\n(ICS) devices has substantially expanded the attack surface of\nmodern networks [1]. As cyber threats grow in sophistication,\nrobust network attack detection remains a critical component\nof cybersecurity infrastructure [2]. Traditional ML approaches,\nsuch as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine\n(SVM), achieve high accuracy on small-scale or binary intru\nsion detection tasks [3], [4], but their performance deteriorates\nin realistic multi-class IoT environments with heterogeneous\nattack types [5]. Moreover, these supervised models cannot\neffectively detect previously unseen (zero-day) attacks without\nretraining, limiting their adaptability to evolving threats.\nRecent advances in Deep Learning (DL) and natural lan\nguage processing (NLP) have introduced Large Language Mod\nels (LLMs) as versatile tools capable of modeling contextual\ndependencies across diverse data modalities [6]. Transformer\nbased LLMs have demonstrated strong potential for intru\nsion detection tasks by leveraging semantic understanding\nand sequence reasoning [6], [7]. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nThis paper was accepted and presented at the 7th Computing, Communica\ntions and IoT Applications Conference (ComComAp 2025), held in Madrid,\nSpain, during 14-17 December 2025.\nmethods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantizes\n(QLoRA) further enable domain-specific adaptation with min\nimal computational and memory overhead, making them well\nsuited for IoT-scale deployments [8].\nTransformer architectures are generally categorized as\nencoder-only, decoder-only, or encoder\u2013decoder models.\nEncoder-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) are effective for\nclassification and structured data representation, while decoder\nonly models (e.g., GPT-2, LLaMA, Mistral) are optimized for\nautoregressive text generation. Decoder models offer distinct\nadvantages in reasoning, interpretability, and zero-shot adap\ntation, particularly when coupled with Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) [9], [10].\nIn this work, we present a unified LLM-based framework\nthat handles both known attacks via QLoRA fine-tuning and\nunknown attacks via RAG, overcoming the retraining limita\ntions of traditional ML. Using the CICIoT2023 dataset [11],\nwe conduct two experiments: (1) supervised fine-tuning of\nlightweight decoder-only LLMs for known attack detection, and\n(2) zero-shot detection of unseen attacks leveraging RAG. The\nmain contributions of this work are:\n\u2022 LLM-based detection: Adapting lightweight decoder\nLLMs with QLoRA for multi-class IoT attack detec\ntion (GPT-2, LLaMA-3.2-1B, Meta-LLaMA-3-8B, and\nMistral-v0.3-7B).\n\u2022 Structured-to-text conversion: Reformulating numerical\nfeatures into concise natural language prompts.\n\u2022 Knownandunknown attack generalization: Leveraging\nRAG to enable zero-shot detection beyond traditional\nsupervised models.\n\u2022 Comparative evaluation: Benchmarking LLMs against\nclassical ML classifiers using standard metrics.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews intrusion\ndetection from classical ML to modern LLMs. Section III\ndetails our methodology, including data preprocessing, QLoRA\nf\nine-tuning, and RAG. Section IV evaluates performance on\nknown and unseen attacks. Finally, Section V concludes and\noutlines limitations and future work.\nII. RELATED WORK\nThis section surveys the evolution of network intrusion\ndetection, from classical machine learning to contemporary\nLLM-based methods, culminating in the challenge of detecting\npreviously unseen attacks.\nClassical machine learning techniques, such as Random\nForest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), have been\nextensively employed for intrusion detection, demonstrating\nstrong performance on balanced datasets [3], [4]. Nevertheless,\ntheir efficacy diminishes in multi-class scenarios with imbal\nanced distributions [5]. Deep learning approaches, particularly\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been explored\nto capture spatial and temporal patterns in network traffic,\nachieving improved detection accuracy [12]. However, these\nsupervised methods generally cannot identify novel attack types\nwithout complete retraining.\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has in\ntroduced advanced contextual reasoning capabilities in cy\nbersecurity. Transformer-based architectures can effectively\nprocess structured network data transformed into textual\nprompts [6], [13]. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, no\ntably QLoRA [14], facilitate the adaptation of large models\nunder computational constraints, enabling effective fine-tuning\nof decoder-only LLMs for known attack classification [15].\nDetecting zero-day attacks remains a significant challenge.\nMeta-learning approaches allow models to adapt to new classes\nwith minimal examples [16], while Generative Adversarial Net\nworks (GANs) have been employed to synthesize data for rare\nattack types [17]. Few-shot and zero-shot learning strategies\nprovide evaluation mechanisms for novel attacks [18], but typ\nically require specialized architectures or extensive retraining.\nRecent deep-learning IDS frameworks have addressed zero-day\nand concept-drift scenarios via adaptive, multi-agent architec\ntures [19]. In contrast, our methodology leverages LLMs with\nretrieval-augmented reasoning to capture semantic relationships\nacross attack behaviors, enabling zero-shot generalization with\nout modifying the model architecture or performing incremental\nupdates.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an\neffective mechanism to incorporate external knowledge, offer\ning contextual evidence for tasks such as log anomaly detection\nwithout requiring parameter updates [20], [21]. Complemen\ntarily, hybrid architectures combining statistical detection with\nLLM-based reasoning have demonstrated improved detection\nperformance in IoT environments [9], [10].\nBuilding on these advances, our approach integrates QLoRA\nbased fine-tuning for known attacks and employs a RAG\nframework for previously unseen attacks, providing a unified\nsystem that supports both supervised classification and zero\nshot generalization in complex IoT networks.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nThis study employs an end-to-end methodology comprising\ndataset preparation, preprocessing, feature selection, structured\nto-text conversion, and fine-tuning of lightweight decoder-only\nLLMs. The workflow integrates prompt design, tokenization,\nand parameter-efficient adaptation using QLoRA. Traditional\nmachine learning models were implemented as baselines for\nperformance comparison. Furthermore, a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) framework was incorporated to enable zero\nshot detection of unseen attack types. The overall workflow of\nthe proposed approach is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nA. Data Preparation\nThe CICIoT2023 dataset [11] was used for this study,\nwhich comprises network traffic from 105 IoT devices and\nincludes 34 classes (33 attacks and benign). To address the\nsignificant class imbalance, a balanced subset was created via\nrandom downsampling. From the dataset, 500 samples per class\nwere allocated for model development (training and validation),\nwhile a separate hold-out set of 100 samples per class was\nreserved for final testing. The development set was further\ndivided using an 80/20 train-validation split, a standard practice\nin IoT IDS research to manage class imbalance in CIC-based\nbenchmarks. A summary of the data splits is provided in\nTable I.\nFor RAG experiments, 1,000 samples per class from 10\nexcluded attack types (unseen classes) were partitioned 70/30\nfor the retrieval knowledge base and testing, ensuring fair\nrepresentation across training, retrieval, and evaluation.\nB. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering\n1) Feature Selection: The dataset contains 44 numerical\nfeatures extracted from network flows. To reduce redundancy\nand multicollinearity, correlation-based feature selection was\napplied. Features with a Pearson coefficient above 0.98 were\nconsidered highly correlated; one feature from each correlated\npair was removed manually after following the exploratory data\nanalysis. The final selected 23 features are listed in Table II.\n2) Data Normalization: Traditional ML models such as RF\nand SVM can be sensitive to differences in feature scales.\nTo avoid this issue, Classical ML models were trained on\nnormalized features using Scikit-learn\u2019s StandardScaler,\nstandardizing each feature to zero mean and unit variance. For\nthe LLM-based models, normalization was not applied since\nfeatures were converted to natural language text. All feature\nvalues were represented as numerical values rounded to six\ndecimal places (numerical text tokens).\nC. Transformation for LLM Processing and RAG integration\nTo adapt the structured network traffic data for LLMs, several\npreprocessing steps were applied to ensure efficient tokeniza\ntion and meaningful text representation. The primary objective\nwas to transform tabular features into concise, semantically\ncoherent natural language prompts suitable for fine-tuning.\n1) Feature and Class Label Standardization: Feature and\nclass names were standardized to maintain consistency and\nminimize unnecessary tokenization. Special characters such as\nhyphens and underscores were replaced with spaces, reducing\ninput sequence length without affecting semantic clarity. Class\nlabels were also simplified into meaningful and LLM-friendly\nnames to ensure alignment with the model\u2019s vocabulary. Rep\nresentative three examples from features and classes are shown\nFig. 1: Workflow summary chart\nTABLE I: Data preparation split for both experiments\nDataset Split Per-Class Count Split Ratio Classes\nUsage\nLLM: Training + Validation 500 80% 24 Trainingsubset\n20% 24 Validationsubset\nLLM: Testing 100\u2013 24 Modelevaluation\nRAG Knowledge Base + RAG Test 1,000 70% 10 RAGKnowledge Base (unseen)\n30% 10 RAGTest (unseen)\nTABLE II: Feature Descriptions\nFeature Name Description\nHeader Length Packet header length\nProtocol Type Transport/network layer protocol\nTime To Live IP packet TTL value\npsh flag number\nack flag number\nPackets with PSH flag set\nPackets with ACK flag set\nTABLE III: Feature and Class Label Standardization Examples\nFeature Name Examples:\nHeader Length \u2192 Header Length\nrst count \u2192 Packets with RST Flag\nIAT \u2192Time Between Packets\nack count\nsyn count\nf\nin count\nrst count\nAcknowledged packets in flow\nPackets with SYN flag set\nPackets with FIN flag set\nPackets with RST flag set\nHTTP HTTPusageinflow(binary)\nHTTPS HTTPSusagein flow (binary)\nDNS DNSusageinflow(binary)\nTCP TCPtransportprotocol (binary)\nUDP UDPtransportprotocol (binary)\nICMP ICMPnetworkprotocol (binary)\nTot sum Totalpacket length in flow\nMin Min.packet size in flow\nMax Max.packet size in flow\nAVG Avg.packet size in flow\nStd Std.dev.ofpacket sizes in flow\nIAT Inter-arrival time of packets\nNumber Totalpackets in flow\nRate Packet transmission rate in flow\nLabel Attack/benign class label\nin Table III, and the full set of selected seen/unseen classes is\nlisted in Table IV.\n2) Prompt Engineering and Tokenization: Each record was\ntransformed into a structured prompt containing the task de\nscription, possible attack classes and feature\u2013value pairs. An\nexample is shown in Table V. During training, the ground-truth\nlabel followed the Answer: token and during the inference,\nthe model predict the class after this token.\nTokenization was performed using Hugging Face\u2019s\nAutoTokenizer with truncation to 512 tokens.\nSince decoder-only models lack a default padding\nClass Label Examples:\nDDOSUDP FLOOD \u2192 ddos udp flood\nMITMARPSPOOFING \u2192 mitm arp spoofing\nDDOSSYN FLOOD \u2192 ddos synchronize flood\nTABLE IV: Seen and Unseen Attack Classes Used in the Study\nSeen Classes (Training/Validation)\nbenign\nddos icmp flood\nddos pshack flood\nddos synchronize flood\nddos tcp flood\nddos udp fragmentation\ndos http flood\ndos tcp flood\nmirai greeth flood\nmirai udp plain\nrecon host discovery\nrecon port scan\nddos ack fragmentation\nddos icmp fragmentation\nddos rst fin flood\nddos synonymousip flood\nddos udp flood\ndns spoofing\ndos synchronize flood\ndos udp flood\nmirai greip flood\nmitm arp spoofing\nrecon os scan\nvulnerability scan\nUnseen Classes (RAG Evaluation)\nbackdoor malware\ncommand injection\nddos slow loris\nrecon ping sweep\ncross site scripting\nbrowser hijacking\nddos http flood\ndictionary brute force\nsql injection\nuploading attack\ntoken, the end-of-sequence (<eos>) token was used\nfor padding.

QLoRA\ncombines 4-bit quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation to\nf\nine-tune large decoders efficiently under resource constraints.\nModel weights are loaded in 4-bit precision with mixed FP16\ncomputation, double quantization, and NF4 for numerical sta\nbility. LoRA adapters are applied to attention projections with\nrank r = 16, scaling factor \u03b1 = 32, dropout 0.1, and frozen\nbiases. Most parameters remain frozen, so only a small subset\nis trainable, reducing memory and computational requirements\nwhile maintaining performance across all LLMs.\n4) Generalization to Unseen Attack Types with RAG: To\nevaluate model generalization, a Retrieval-Augmented Gen\neration (RAG) framework was integrated into the fine-tuned\nLLM workflow. Attack types excluded from training were used\nas unseen classes. Their feature vectors were embedded to\nconstruct a retrieval knowledge base. During inference, each\ntest instance was compared against this base using cosine\nsimilarity, and the top 20 most similar samples were identified.\nThe top 3 retrieved examples were concatenated with the query\ninstance (within token constraints) to form the final prompt.\nThis prompt provided contextual reference for the LLM\nto infer unseen attack types. The model\u2019s predictions were\ngenerated based on both the query flow and the retrieved\nexemplars. Evaluation metrics included Accuracy, Precision,\nRecall, and F1-score for classification, and top-k (k=3) recall\nfor retrieval effectiveness. This methodological setup enabled\nstructured assessment of zero-shot generalization capability\nusing retrieval support.\n5) Hardware Setup: LLM experiments were conducted on\ntwo separate GPUs: NVIDIA RTX 4080 (16GiB CUDA mem\nory) for GPT-2 and LLaMA-3.2-1B, and NVIDIA RTX 4090\n(32GiB CUDA memory) for Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B\nf\nine-tuning.\nIV. RESULTS\nThis section presents the outcomes of the two experiments:\n(1) direct classification using fine-tuned models and classical\nbaselines, and (2) RAG-based evaluation for unseen attacks.\nA. Experiment 1: Direct Classification\n1) Model Training and Hyperparameters: In the first phase,\nthe models are trained and evaluated on attack classes included\nin the training set. Classical ML classifiers (RF, SVM, and\nLogistic Regression (LR)) are trained directly on normalized\nfeature vectors. In parallel, decoder-based LLMs including\nGPT-2, LLaMA-3.2-1B, Meta-LLaMA-3-8B, and Mistral-v0.3\n7B are fine-tuned on textual prompts constructed from the\nsame features. All LLM models were fine-tuned using the\nQLoRA setup described earlier. The main fine-tuning settings\nare summarized in Table VI.\n2) Parameter Efficiency: Table VII reports the number and\nproportion of trainable parameters. Only a small fraction of\neach model\u2019s parameters are updated, confirming QLoRA\u2019s\nparameter efficiency and suitability for resource-limited deploy\nment.\n3) Performance Evaluation: Model performance was eval\nuated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score on the\ntest dataset. Results are summarized in Table VIII.\nAmong baseline models, Random Forest achieved the highest\nperformance (Accuracy = 0.7171, F1 = 0.7159). For fine-tuned\nLLMs, LLaMA 3.2-1B achieved the best F1-score (0.7124)\nwith balanced metrics, followed by Mistral-7B (F1 = 0.6992).\nAlthough LLMs require higher inference time, their runtime re\nmains practical for offline or batch intrusion analysis. LLaMA\n3.2-1B offers a favorable balance between accuracy and com\npute cost (235 s), showing that lightweight LLMs can deliver\nstrong detection under modest hardware while enabling zero\nshot generalization not achievable with traditional models.\n4) Per-Class Performance: LLaMA 3.2-1B, the best\nperforming fine-tuned model, was used for detailed class-wise\nevaluation. Results are presented in Table IX.\nHigh F1-scores (\u2265 0.98) for DDoS and Mirai-based attacks\nsuch as ddos icmp flood, mirai udp plain, and ddos pshack\nf\nlood indicate strong detection of highly distinctive attack\nsignatures. Conversely, lower F1-scores for recon os scan,\nvulnerability scan, and ddos synchronize flood reveal difficulty\nin differentiating subtle or overlapping network behaviors.\nThe per-class metric plot (Fig. 2) visually reinforces the\nquantitative findings, highlighting strong predictive accuracy\nfor most attack types while revealing misclassifications in\nclasses that share similar traffic characteristics.\nTABLE VI: LLM Fine-tuning Configuration\nParameter Value\nLoRA Settings Rank r = 16, Scaling \u03b1 = 32, Dropout = 0.1\nTarget Layers Attention/ MLP\nEpochs 3\u20135\nBatch Size 4 (7B and 8B model),16 (other models)\nLearning Rate varies (0.0005 or 0.00005)\nOptimizer AdamW\nWeight Decay 0.2\nMixed Precision FP16\nTABLE VII: Trainable Parameters Compared to Total Model\nSize\nModel Trainable Total Trainable %\nGPT-2 1.57M 356.40M 0.44%\nLLaMA-3.2 1B 2.36M 1,238.17M 0.19%\nMistral-v0.3-7B 9.44M 7,257.46M 0.13%\nLLaMA-3.1 8B 9.44M 8,039.70M 0.12%\nFig. 2: Per-Class Precision, Recall, and for LLaMA 3.2-1B\nTABLE VIII: Test Set Evaluation Metrics for All Models\nModel Accuracy F1 Precision Recall Runtime/s\nLR 0.6792 0.6778 0.6792 0.6676 0.0004\nRF 0.7171 0.7159 0.7171 0.7143 0.0245\nSVM 0.6470 0.6761 0.6650 0.6650 0.6718\nLLaMA-3.2-1B 0.7117 0.7124 0.7173 0.7117 235.16\nMistral-7B 0.7104 0.6992 0.7210 0.7104 1050.58\nLLaMA-3.8-8B 0.6796 0.6792 0.6824 0.6796 679.51\nGPT-2 0.6567 0.6271 0.6617 0.6567 191.05\nTABLE IX: Per-Class Classification Report for Test Set\n(LLaMA 3.2-1B)\nClass Precision Recall F1 Support\nBenign 0.45 0.48 0.46 100\nddos ack fragmentation 0.98 1.00 0.99 100\nddos icmp flood 1.00 1.00 1.00 100\nddos icmp fragmentation 1.00 0.97 0.98 100\nddos pshack flood 1.00 1.00 1.00 100\nddos rst fin flood 1.00 1.00 1.00 100\nddos synchronize flood 0.37 0.40 0.38 100\nddos synonymousip flood 0.41 0.51 0.46 100\nddos tcp flood 0.58 0.62 0.60 100\nddos udp flood 0.67 0.77 0.72 100\nddos udp fragmentation 0.99 0.99 0.99 100\ndns spoofing 0.69 0.56 0.62 100\ndos http flood 1.00 0.99 0.99 100\ndos synchronize flood 0.54 0.37 0.44 100\ndos tcp flood 0.59 0.54 0.56 100\ndos udp flood 0.73 0.63 0.68 100\nmirai greeth flood 0.99 0.96 0.97 100\nmirai greip flood 0.96 1.00 0.98 100\nmirai udp plain 1.00 1.00 1.00 100\nmitm arp spoofing 0.57 0.59 0.58 100\nrecon host discovery 0.49 0.46 0.48 100\nrecon os scan 0.21 0.21 0.21 100\nrecon port scan 0.21 0.23 0.22 100\nvulnerability scan 0.43 0.46 0.45 100\nMacro Avg 0.70 0.70 0.70 2400\nWeighted Avg 0.70 0.70 0.70 2400\nAccuracy 0.70 2400\nB. Experiment 2: RAG-Based Evaluation for Unseen Attacks\n1) Numerical Embedding Retrieval: Before passing input\nprompts to the LLM, we evaluated the ability of the numer\nical embeddings to retrieve relevant examples from the RAG\nknowledge base. For each test instance, we computed cosine\nsimilarity against all examples in the knowledge base and\nconsidered the top 20 candidates. The metric used is Top\n3 Recall, which indicates whether at least one of the top 3\nretrieved candidates matches the actual class of the test sample.\nPer-Class evaluation is shown in Table XI.\nAcross all 3,000 test samples, the overall Top-3 Recall was\n63.27% (1898/3000), indicating that for nearly two-thirds of\nthe test instances, at least one of the top 3 candidates retrieved\nfrom the knowledge base matched the true class. This retrieval\nstep ensures that the subsequent LLM input is enriched with\nrelevant examples, improving its ability to classify unseen or\ndifficult attack types.\n2) RAG Prompt Construction and Generation Settings:\nFrom the top 20 retrieved candidates, the three most similar\nwere concatenated with the current input. Prompts were trun\ncated to 1015 tokens and limited to six generated tokens. The\nf\ninal prediction was extracted after the last Answer: token.\nThe Table X illustrates a RAG-augmented prompt example used\nand its model output (shown in bold).\nTABLE X: RAG-augmented prompt example with generated\noutput in bold text\nRetrieved Examples:\nInput: {Header Length=27.6; Protocol Type=6.0; IP TTL=57.3;\n. . . ; Total Packets=10}\nAnswer: recon ping sweep\nInput: {Header Length=25.6; Protocol Type=6.0; IP TTL=78.8;\n. . . ; Total Packets=10}\nAnswer: sql injection\nInput: {Header Length=21.6; Protocol Type=6.0; IP TTL=56.8;\n. . . ; Total Packets=10}\nAnswer: recon ping sweep\nTask: Network Attack Classification;\nPossible Classes: [recon ping sweep, sql injection]\nExample Input: {Header Length=25.6; Protocol Type=6.0; IP\nTTL=52.8; ...; Total Packets=10}\nAnswer: recon ping sweep\nThis format helps the model reason about unseen attacks by\ngrounding predictions in semantically similar examples.\nV.

High precision and recall\nscores for classes such as DDoS Slow Loris and DDoS HTTP\nFlood suggest that the retrieval mechanism effectively supple\nments contextual understanding for well-represented behavioral\npatterns in the external knowledge base. In contrast, lower per\nformance on complex or less distinctive attacks like Backdoor\nMalware, Cross Site Scripting, and Uploading Attack reflects\nthe inherent challenge of modeling subtle variations in traffic\nfeatures when semantic overlap exists between categories.\nThese findings demonstrate that integrating retrieval-based\naugmentation helps bridge the gap between seen and unseen\nclasses, enabling LLMs to extend beyond fixed supervised\nboundaries typical of classical ML models. Although over\nall accuracy remains moderate, the RAG framework shows\npromise for incremental adaptation, where the knowledge base\ncan be continuously enriched with new attack exemplars to\nimprove coverage and robustness against emerging IoT threats.\nThis suggests a viable direction for future work toward hybrid\nretrieval\u2013generation intrusion detection frameworks.\nThis study shows that lightweight decoder-only LLMs,\nadapted using structured-to-text conversion, QLoRA fine\ntuning, and RAG, form an efficient unified framework for IoT\nintrusion detection. On CICIoT2023, the fine-tuned LLaMA-1B\nmodel achieved an F1-score of 0.7124, matching the Random\nForest baseline (0.7159) on known attacks, while the RAG\nenhanced model reached 42.63% accuracy on unseen attack\ntypes without additional training, demonstrating practical zero\nshot capability beyond traditional ML. By combining parameter\nefficiency with retrieval-based context grounding, the proposed\napproach offers a scalable and resource-aware solution suitable\nfor evolving IoT environments. A key limitation is that results\nwere obtained on a single dataset, and broader validation\nacross heterogeneous IoT benchmarks is required. Future work\nwill explore improved retrieval strategies, larger and more\ndiverse knowledge bases, and lightweight ensemble methods\nto enhance detection of subtle or overlapping attack patterns.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.

In this work,\nwe propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided\nGraph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters\nand complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph\nknowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where\na semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store\nfrom centrality-based motif.

Toenable\nefficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmenta\ntion to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs\nas contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ngraph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outper\nforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and\ngraph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.\nCCSConcepts\n\u2022 Mathematics of computing \u2192 Graph algorithms; \u2022 Com\nputing methodologies \u2192 Neural networks; Learning latent\nrepresentations; Knowledge representation and reasoning.\n\u2217Corresponding author.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\nNoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\nWWW\u201926,Dubai, United Arab Emirates\n\u00a92026 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).\nACMISBN979-8-4007-2307-0/2026/04\nhttps://doi.org/10.1145/3774904.3792139\nKeywords\nGraph Foundation Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Multi\ndomain Graph Pre-training, Graph Prompt Learning\nACMReference Format:\nHaonan Yuan, Qingyun Sun, Jiacheng Tao, Xingcheng Fu, and Jianxin Li.\n2026.

ACM, New\nYork, NY, USA, 12 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3774904.3792139\n1 Introduction\nGraphs are powerful structures for describing complex relation\nships among entities, and have been broadly adopted in domains\nsuch asmodelingfortheWorldWideWeb[1,50],socialandcitation\nnetworks [7, 76], retrieval and recommendation systems [62, 65],\nknowledge graphs [63, 79], biological analysis [9, 67], etc. Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) [12, 20] have enabled effective represen\ntation learning on graphs, supporting a wide range of tasks, but\nare typically tailored to specific datasets and tasks, limiting cross\ndomain generalization. Motivated by large-scale pre-training in\nlanguage and vision, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have re\ncently emerged to learn universal graph representations through\npre-training and downstream adaptation [11, 14, 29, 34, 43, 44, 77],\naiming to support diverse applications with minimal supervision.\nDespite these advances, existing GFMs face fundamental limita\ntions. Current methods follow the \u201cpretrain-then-finetune\u201d para\ndigm overwhelmingly, where knowledge from source domains is ei\nther fully compressedintoasingleGFM\u2019smodelparameters[74,81],\nor at best expanded through lightweight mixtures-of-experts (MoE)\nthat remainlargelyconceptualandofferlittlepractical relief [10, 78].\nWhile parameter counts may increase marginally, they fall far short\nof matching the vast, orders-of-magnitude greater knowledge vol\nume inherent in pre-training domains. Graph knowledge is inher\nently dual-modal, combining node-level semantic texts and higher\norder structural patterns, which leads to inevitable in-memory\nbottlenecks that hinder scalability, robustness, and interpretability.\nWWW\u201926,April 13\u201317, 2026, Dubai, United Arab Emirates\nHaonan Yuan, Qingyun Sun, Jiacheng Tao, Xingcheng Fu, and Jianxin Li\n<president_of>\nChallenge I\nLimited Capacity\n<president_of>\nData:\nTB\nGFM \nParameter:\nMB\nChallenge II\nLossy Compression\nGFM \nencode\nGFM \ndecode\nChallenge III\nEntangled Storage\nGFM pre-training\nU.S.\nJoe Biden\nupdate\nU.S.\nDonald Trump\nGFM fine-tuning\nHow to solve \u201cin-memory bo\ue03clenecks\u201d dilemma for GFMs?\nFigure 1: Challenges of the \u201cin-memory bottlenecks\u201d.\nChallenge I: Limited capacity within parameters. Graph\nknowledge spans rich information whose scale far exceeds what\nmodelparameterscanstore.Ingraphmodels,increasingparameters\nor depth often causes over-smoothing rather than higher capac\nity [3, 18]. Consequently, GFMs trained on a single domain quickly\nexhaust their parameter budget when transferred to others with dis\ntinct semantics and motifs, leading to forgetting, poor transfer, and\nlimited scalability [41, 82]. This exposes the fundamental limitation\nof parameter-centric storage for graphs.\nChallenge II: Lossy and conflicting compression. Forcing\nheterogeneous graph knowledge into parameters inevitably causes\nlossy and conflicting compression. Identical structural patterns may\ncarry opposite semantics across domains, and collapsing them into\nshared embeddings distorts meaning. Moreover, such compression\nis irreversible: once absorbed into weights, knowledge cannot be\nretrieved, verified, or updated without retraining, undermining\ntransparency and grounded reasoning.\nChallenge III: Entangled representation and storage. The\nparameter-based storage tightly entangles knowledge with repre\nsentations, hindering efficient adaptation. Fine-tuning simultane\nously adjusts task-specific features and updates memorized knowl\nedge, making learning inefficient and data-intensive. This entangle\nment also obscures interpretability, as predictions cannot be traced\nto explicit evidence, reducing reliability in high-stakes applications.\nOurkeyinsightistomovebeyondparameter-centricstorageby\nexternalizing graph knowledge, inspired by Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) [22]. Unlike text, graph knowledge is fragmented\nacross attributes and structures, making retrieval more challeng\ning. Existing GFMs compress such evidence into parameters, los\ning explicit access and updatability. We argue that treating graph\nknowledge as first-class retrievable objects enables external storage,\naligned pre-training, and scalable, interpretable adaptation.\nIn this work, we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration aided Graph Foundation Model. RAG-GFM incorpo\nrates three key components. First, we construct a dual-store uni\nf\nied retrieval database, consisting of a semantic store from prefix\nstructured text embeddings and a structural store from centrality\nbased motif encodings, enabling GFMs to query external knowledge\non demand. Second, we design a dual-view alignment objective that\ncontrasts semantic representation with structural subgraphs dur\ning pre-training, ensuring complementary representation learning\nacross modalities. Third, we introduce in-context sample augmen\ntation, where retrieved texts and motifs are appended as contextual\nevidence for few-shot adaptation, enriching support instances with\nexplicit external knowledge. Our contributions are:\n\u2022 Wepropose RAG-GFM,the first retrieval-augmented graph foun\ndation model that explicitly addresses in-memory bottlenecks.\n\u2022 Wedesign a dual-store retrieval module, a dual-view alignment\nobjective, and an in-context sample augmentation mechanism,\nproviding a unified pipeline for knowledge externalization, ro\nbust pre-training, and efficient adaptation.\n\u2022 Extensive experiments on six benchmark graph datasets demon\nstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the\nart GFM baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classifi\ncation, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.\n2 Related Work\nGraph Foundation Models (GFMs). GFMs extend large-scale\npre-training to graphs via self-supervised learning [2, 4, 30, 47, 68,\n71]. Most assume distributional similarity between pre-training\nand downstream tasks [16, 80], limiting robustness under domain\nshift. Recent work explores cross- or multi-domain learning, LLM\nalignment, domain tokens, and structural guarantees [14, 26, 26, 51\n53, 61, 64, 70, 75, 78, 81], yet GFMs remain parameter-centric and\nstruggle with structural and semantic consistency.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG enhances the\nLLMs by retrieving external knowledge to mitigate context limits\nand hallucinations [6]. Using lexical or semantic retrieval with\nqueryoptimization andre-ranking [23, 32, 40], RAGachievesstrong\nperformance in QA and reasoning [17, 54]. Extensions to graph\ndata motivate GraphRAG [13, 19, 33, 39, 49, 56, 66]. While GFM\nRAG[31] uses GFMs to improve RAG, we instead leverage RAG to\nfundamentally enhance GFMs.\n3 Notations and Preliminaries\nNotations. We represent a graph as\ud835\udc3a = (V,E), where V denotes\nthe set of nodes and E the set of edges. For a graph\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56 sampled from\nany of the source domains, let A \u2208 {0,1}\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\u00d7\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56 be the adjacency\nmatrix and X \u2208 R\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 be the node feature matrix. Here, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56 = |V\ud835\udc56|\ndenotes the number of nodes, and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 denotes the original input\nfeature dimension. Z, W, H are the hidden representations.\nMulti-domainPre-training. Let GS = {\ud835\udc3aS\n1 ,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,\ud835\udc3aS\ud835\udc5b} denote a\ncollection of source graphs from domains DS, each associated with\nlabels YS. We cast pre-training as a self-supervised link prediction\nproblem with universal templates [27], ensuring task consistency\nwith downstream settings. The learner is defined as \u210e =\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc53\ud835\udeaf(\u00b7)),\nwhere the encoder \ud835\udc53 : R\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 \u21a6\u2192 R\ud835\udc51 produces node embeddings and\nthe discriminator \ud835\udc54: R\ud835\udc51 \u00d7 R\ud835\udc51 \u21a6\u2192 R2 predicts link existence. Once\nthe pre-training converges, parameter \ud835\udeaf\u2605 is frozen as the backbone.\nFew-shot Fine-tuning. We consider graphs GT from target do\nmains DT (seen or unseen). Under\ud835\udc5a-shot setting (\ud835\udc5a \u226a \ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56),\nonly \ud835\udc5a labeled samples YT are available. Fine-tuning applies the\npre-trained \u210e =\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc53\u2605\n\ud835\udeaf\n(\u00b7)) augmented with learnable prompts P\ud835\udec0,\nwhere \ud835\udec0 denotes tunable parameters. Both node and graph clas\nsification (via node-centered ego-graphs) are reformulated as link\nprediction, maintaining homogeneity with pre-training.\nOvercomingIn-MemoryBottlenecksinGraphFoundationModelsviaRetrieval-AugmentedGeneration WWW\u201926,April13\u201317,2026,Dubai,UnitedArabEmirates\n(2) Pretrain: Cross-View Alignment\nCitation\n(1)Unified Retrieval Database\n\u2026\nE-Commerce Web Link\n(3)Fine-tune: In-Context Q&A\nGraph Learner \n(Graph Neural Networks)\nNanoVectorDB\nSemantic DB Structural DB\n<Dataset> \n<Node ID>\n<Label>\n<Description>\n<Node Text>\nWalk-Spectrum Encoding\n1\n1\n1\n1\n3\n4\n2\n2\n2 3\n1\n1\n1\n1\n3\n4\n2\n2\n2 3\n1\n1\n1\n1\n3\n4\n2\n2\n2 3\nSemantic View Structural View\n1 3 2\n1 3 2\n1 3 2\n\ud83d\udd25 Pretrained Domain Tokens:\nRaw Text Raw Text Raw Text\n\u201ca graph neural \nnetwork for node \nclassification\u2026\u201d\n\u201cwireless Bluetooth \nheadphones with\nnoise cancellation\u2026\u201d\n\u201cofficial homepage \nfor AI tutorials \nand resources \u2026\u201d\nWorld-wide News Event\nQuery #1\n\u201c\u2026earthquake struck \nTurkey causing severe \ndamage and casualties\u2026\u201d\n1\n2\n3\n4\nAnswer #1\n\u201c\u2026real-time earthquake \nmonitoring using graph\nbased warning systems\u2026\u201d\n1\n2\n3\n5\nQuery #2\n\u201c\u2026leaders gatherin\nDubai for Global Climate \nSummit to discuss\u2026\u201d\nAnswer #2\n\u201c\u2026live coverage of the \nCOP28 summit in Dubai \nwith daily policy updates\u2026\u201d\n1\n2\n3 4\n< \nCitation \n> <Web Link>\n1\n2\n4\n5\n|| [ ] \u2299 \u2299 Mixed Token Prompts In-Context Augmentation\n\ud83d\udd25\n\u2744\n\u2026\n\ud835\udc3aS\n1 \ud835\udc3aS\n2 \ud835\udc3aS\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc3aT\n1 \ud835\udc3aT\n2 \ud835\udc3aT\n3 \ud835\udc3aT\ud835\udc5a\nP\ud835\udec0\nHtext Hstruct\n\u210e=\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc53\ud835\udeaf(\u00b7))\n(1) (2) (3)\nFigure2:TheframeworkofRAG-GFM.Theframeworkincludesthreestages:(1)UnifiedSemantic-StructuralBi-ModalRetrieval\nDatabaseforexternalizinggraphknowledge,(2)Cross-ViewKnowledgeAlignmentforpre-trainingtransferablepriors,and(3)\nIn-ContextRetrievalAugmentationforfew-shotadaptationviadomain-gatedlightweightgraphprompts.\n4 Method\nWeillustratetheframeworkofRAG-GFMinFigure2.\n4.1 UnifiedSemantic-StructuralBi-Modal\nRetrievalDatabase\nAtthecoreofourframeworkliesaunifiedretrievaldatabasethat\nexternalizesknowledgeintotwocomplementarymodalities:ase\nmanticstorethatorganizesenrichednodetextsasretrievabledoc\numents,andastructuralstorethatcapturesmotif-levelpatterns.\nFormally,wedenotethebi-modaldatabase\u2217asD={Dtext,Dstruct}.\nGivenqueryqandscoringfunction\ud835\udc60(\u00b7,\u00b7),theretrievaloperatoris:\nRetrieve(D,q,\ud835\udc58)=argTop-\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc62,z\ud835\udc62)\u2208D[\ud835\udc60(q,z\ud835\udc62)], (1)\nwitheachentry(\ud835\udc62,z\ud835\udc62)denotingadatabaserecordidentifiedby\ud835\udc62\nanddescribedbyz\ud835\udc62.Disqueriedinbothpre-trainingandfine\ntuning,whichallowsRAG-GFMtogroundpredictionsinexplicit\nsemanticandstructuralevidenceratherthanobscureparameters.\n4.1.1 SemanticStore.Unlikerawnodefeaturesreducedtonu\nmericalvectors,mostofthegraphsaretext-attributed,withnodes\nfromsourcessuchasabstracts,productdescriptions,orprofiles.\nWerecovereachnode\u2019srawtextt\ud835\udc63bytracingitbacktoitsorig\ninalcorpus(e.g.,metadataincitations)[24,25],andtreat itasa\nfirst-classsignal.Thesemanticpipelinebranchesintotwotracks:\nOntherepresentationtrack,weaddressthedimension-wise\nmismatchofrawfeaturesacrossdomainsusingPCA[38].Foreach\ngraph\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56withfeaturematrixX\ud835\udc56 \u2208R\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56,weapply:\nXS\n\ud835\udc56 =PCA\ud835\udc510\n(XS\n\ud835\udc56 )\u2208R\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\u00d7\ud835\udc510.

For clarity, we present query and\nretrieval in node-level settings. The extension to graph-level tasks\nfollows directly by treating each graph as a single instance.\nSemantic Retrieval.

We analyse\nthe fine-tuning pipeline in Algorithm 2 with complexity analysis.\n4.4 Algorithms and Complexity\nShown in Appendix A, RAG-GFM consists of two stages. In pre\ntraining, dual-view encoding and self-supervised alignment dom\ninate the cost, yielding O(\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc38B + |B|)\ud835\udc51 + |B|2\ud835\udc51) per iteration,\nwhere \ud835\udc38B is the edge count in batch B. In fine-tuning, semantic re\ntrieval and structural motif retrieval are combined via domain-gated\nfusion and prompt-based classification, giving O(\ud835\udc5a[log\ud835\udc40text +\n\ud835\udc5blog\ud835\udc40struct + (\ud835\udc58 + \ud835\udc5b +\ud835\udc36)\ud835\udc51]) per iteration, with \ud835\udc40text and \ud835\udc40struct\nthe database sizes and\ud835\udc36 the class number. Retrieval adds only loga\nrithmic overhead, while adaptation updates prompts instead of full\nparameters, ensuring much lower cost than end-to-end fine-tuning.\nOverall, the complexity remains comparable to state-of-the-art\nGFMs while achieving superior efficiency in few-shot adaptation.\n5 Experiment\nWeevaluate RAG-GFM\u2020, focusing on the these research questions:\n\u2022 RQ1: Howeffective on cross-dataset or cross-domain few-shot\nnode and graph classification?

To emphasize the pre-training capability across\nheterogeneous domains, we adopt five benchmark text-attributed\ngraph datasets spanning three distinct domains. This design con\ntrasts with conventional settings that often regard a single dataset\nas an independent domain, offering a more challenging evaluation.\n\u2022 Citation Domain: Cora [35], CiteSeer [8], PubMed [42].\n\u2022 E-Commerce Domain: Ogbn-Products [15] from a large-scale\nproduct co-purchase network, which includes sub-categories.\n\u2022 WebLinkDomain:Wiki-CS[36],ahyperlinkwebpagenetwork\nconstructed from a subset of Wikipedia.\n5.1.2 Baselines.

Weevaluatenode\nand graph-level classification under the \ud835\udc5a-shot setting, where \ud835\udc5a\nlabeled samples per class are randomly selected. For graph task, ego\ngraphs centered on target nodes are extracted and labeled by central\nnodes [28, 73, 75]. To assess generalization, we adopt two leave-out\nstrategies, both referred to as LODO: (1) Leave-One-Dataset-Out,\nholding out one dataset as target; and (2) Leave-One-Domain-Out,\nexcluding an entire domain during pre-training. These variants\ncapture transferability across unseen datasets and unseen domains.\nResults are reported by mean values with standard deviation.\n\u2020

In WWW. 2183\u20132197.\nA AlgorithmsandComplexity Analysis\nWeillustrate the overall pre-training pipeline of RAG-GFM in Al\ngorithm 1, and the fine-tuning pipeline in Algorithm 2.\nA.1 Complexity Analsys of Algorithm 1\nThe pre-training pipeline mainly consists of three stages:\nDatabase Construction. For each source domain \ud835\udc37S\n\ud835\udc56 with \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\nnodes, \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 edges, and feature dimension \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56, we first project node\nfeatures into a unified space of dimension \ud835\udc510 via PCA, which costs\nO(\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc510). BERT encodes each node\u2019s text with the complexity of\nO(\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc36BERT), where \ud835\udc36BERT denotes the per-sample encoding cost.\nFor the structural store, computing \ud835\udc3e-order WSE requires O(\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56)\nwith sparse matrix multiplications, followed by top-\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 anchor se\nlection O(\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56 log\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56) and \u210e-hop ego-subgraph extraction O(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 \n\u00af\ud835\udc51\u210e\n\ud835\udc56 )\nwith \u00af\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 as average degree. Over \ud835\udc5b domains, the complexity is:\n\u2211\n\ufe01\n\ud835\udc5b\nO\n\ud835\udc56=1\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc510 + \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc36BERT +\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56 log\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56 +\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 \n\u00af\ud835\udc51\u210e\n\ud835\udc56 . (A.1)\nCross-view Encoding. At each iteration, a mixed-domain batch\nBofsize |B| issampled.Two\ud835\udc3f-layerGNNencoderswithdimension\n\ud835\udc51 are applied to semantic and structural views, giving complexity:\nO2\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc38B +|B|)\ud835\udc51 ,\n(A.2)\nwhere \ud835\udc38B is the number of edges in the sampled batch B.\nSelf-supervised Pre-training. The cross-view InfoNCE com\nputes pairwise similarities, with cost O(|B|2\ud835\udc51). The compression\nregularizers introduce O(|B|\ud835\udc51), negligible compared to the qua\ndratic term. Token regularization across \ud835\udc5b domains costs O(\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51).\nOverall Complexity. The dominant cost per iteration is:\nO\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc38B +|B|)\ud835\udc51 + |B|2\ud835\udc51 ,\n(A.3)\nwhile database construction is a one-time preprocessing overhead.\nSummary. The dominant cost comes from GNN propagation\nand quadratic contrastive alignment. Database construction is per\nformed once and is negligible compared to iterative training.\nA.2 Complexity Analsys of Algorithm 2\nIn the fine-tuning phase, the encoders \ud835\udeaf\u2605\n\ud835\udc61 ,\ud835\udeaf\u2605\n\ud835\udc60 and domain tokens\n{\ud835\udf49\ud835\udc37} are frozen, and only prompt parameters \ud835\udec0 are optimized.\nPreprocessing. For\ud835\udc5a-shot support instances with raw dimen\nsion \ud835\udc51T, preprocessing requires O(\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51T\ud835\udc510 +\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc36BERT).\nDomain-gated Fusion. For each support instance, similarities\nwith \ud835\udc5b domain tokens are computed at cost O(\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51).\nSemantic Retrieval. Each query searches Dtext of size \ud835\udc40text\nusing approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) with O(log\ud835\udc40text) per\nquery. Aggregating top-\ud835\udc58 answers incurs O(\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc510). The total cost is:\nO\ud835\udc5a(log\ud835\udc40text +\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc510) .\n(A.4)\nStructural Retrieval.

  "Towards Understanding Best Practices for\nQuantization of Vision-Language Models\nGautom Das\u2217 Vincent La\u2217 EthanLau\u2217 AbhinavShrivastava MatthewGwilliam\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park\narXiv:2601.15287v1  [cs.CV]  21 Jan 2026\nAbstract\nLarge language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results for a variety of tasks,\nbut state-of-the-art systems require fast GPUs with large amounts of memory.\nTo reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize\ntheir learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research\nfocuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths,\nand some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like\nvision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization\nmethods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively\nto multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their\nconnectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question\nanswering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of\nthe pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit\ncomparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in\nparameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy\nat reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for\nefficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for under\nstanding component sensitivities in multimodal models. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/gautomdas/mmq.\n1 Introduction\nAs neural networks grow larger, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs) [1], it has\nbecome increasingly important to reduce memory and computational demands [2]. Training these\nmodels demands massive GPU/TPU clusters, and even inference can be costly [3]. Additionally,\ndistributed multi-GPU setups are not practical for model deployment on edge devices and in similar\nreal-world scenarios [4]. As these models become more ubiquitous, their cost and accessibility\nbecome massively important societal issues.\nWhile text-only LLMs are expensive enough on their own, real-world applications increasingly\nrequire models that can process not only text, but also audio and visual data, leading to the rise of\nmultimodal LLMs (MLLMs) [5, 6]. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which combine\nLLMs with vision encoders (and/or audio encoders [7]), require even more resources, and exacerbate\ncost and accessibility issues. While these can deliver impressive performance on multimodal retrieval,\ncaptioning, and question-answering tasks, the performance typically scales with model size and\nlatency. Video data drives additional massive increases in latency and memory consumption.\nModel compression, particularly quantization, offers a potential solution to the growing model size\nproblem [2]. One goal of model compression is to find where \u201cfree lunch\u201d ends\u2013 how small we\ncan make a model without sacrificing performance. Another goal is to aggressively compress the\nmodel beyond this point, while mitigating the penalty to performance. Quantization tackles this by\n*Equal contribution.\nPreprint.

For uniform quantization, we perform\na dense grid search of bit widths and combinations of these components. For state-of-the-art methods\n(GPTQ and AWQ)weperform a more targeted analysis.\nby introducing a Q-Former to bridge the gap between frozen image models [11, 23] and frozen\nlanguage models [24]. LLaVA [6] uses a simpler projector to connect the frozen models, but finetunes\nboth using instruction tuning. In this work, we investigate how quantization affects both BLIP-2 and\nLLaVA as representative VLLMs.\n2.2 Model Compression\nPruning seeks to remove neurons of low saliency, often resulting in sparser computation. This can be\ndone in an unstructured manner [25\u201328], where individual weights are removed, wherever they may\noccur, or in a structured manner [29\u201331], where entire layers are removed. While this can greatly\nreduce model size and FLOPs, it often comes at the cost of model accuracy. The pruning process can\nbe done iteratively to monitor performance degradation, or fine-tuning can be done afterward to help\nrecover the performance of the full-sized model.\nKnowledge distillation (KD) involves training a smaller, compact student model to mimic the\nbehavior of a larger teacher model. The student model uses logits from the larger teacher as soft\ntargets during training [32\u201337]. KD often struggles to achieve high compression ratios on its own,\nwhen compared to pruning or quantization, as an overly compressed student model can struggle to\napproximate the complexity of the teacher model.\nQuantization refers to a reduction in the numerical precision of neural network weights and acti\nvations [38, 39]. It is often utilized for the deployment of models on edge devices, achieving more\nefficient inference by leveraging low-bit integer arithmetic [2]. Quantization methods tend to fall\ninto two categories: post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). PTQ\ninvolves quantizing weights/activations after training a full-precision model, often using a representa\ntive calibration set to determine scales, clipping ranges, and the saliency of parameters [8, 9, 40\u201347].\nQAT involves quantizing a model and then training/fine-tuning a model to adjust parameters to\nrecover model performance degradation [48\u201352]. PTQ is more lightweight than QAT as it does\nnot require additional training. Recent interest in extreme quantization of LLMs has even resulted\nin a third paradigm, related to QAT, where the architecture itself is designed with quantization in\nmind, utilizing ternary and even binary weights [53\u201355]. Quantization can be combined with pruning\nor distillation of knowledge for even larger amounts of model compression [56\u201358]. In this work,\nwe focus specifically on quantization methods which may require calibration, but do not require\nany additional training/fine-tuning. These include uniform quantization, as well as state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods, GPTQ [8] and AWQ [9]. Instead of applying these to unimodal models (LLMs),\nwe investigate how well they work in the multimodal setting.\n3 Optimizing Performance\n3.1 Building Intuitions\nFor our preliminary experiment, we explore the impact of reduced bit widths on different parts\nof the BLIP-2 architecture via simulated uniform quantization.

WeapplyGPTQandAWQtoentiremodelcomponents(visionencoder, connector, LLM),\nof BLIP-2 and LLaVA. Unimodal SOTA methods are able to preserve full-precision performance at\nhigh compression rates, even in the multimodal context.\nSince we observe in Section 3.1 that the choice of block group has little to no impact on quan\ntized model performance, we conduct these experiments with a coarser granularity. We quantize\nentire model components (vision encoder, LLM, Q-Former) to k-bits. In addition, we expand our\nbenchmarks to include visual question-answering (VQA) on VQAv2 [22] and GQA [21]. Both are\nsuccessors of prior VQA datasets that contained biases, giving a false sense of understanding.\n3.3 State-of-the-art Quantization Benchmark\nFor each task, we randomly sample a set of 128 image and text pairs from the respective dataset to\nserve as the calibration set for AWQ and GPTQ. We evaluate BLIP-2 ViT-g for retrieval, and BLIP-2\nViT-g OPT 2.7B for captioning and VQA tasks. Additionally, we evaluate LLaVA 1.5 7B for VQA\ntasks. We evaluate on 10% of the val2014 split for VQAv2, which equates to 21435 samples, and on\nthe entire Test-Dev split for GQA.\nIt is important to note that typically, when unimodal SOTA quantization methods are applied to\nMLLMs, only the language model component is quantized. In our search space, we include configu\nrations where we also quantize the vision model and connector components. Our SOTA quantization\nexperiment search space selects bit widths from {2,3,4,5,6,8} and considers model components\nC \u2286{ViT,LLM,Q-Former} for BLIP-2 and model components C \u2286 {ViT,LLM} for LLaVA.\nWeshowresults for our SOTA experiments in Figure 4. Overall, the unimodal SOTA methods are able\nto preserve task performance better at more extreme bit widths than uniform quantization. For uniform\nquantization, the configurations with the lowest bpw that achieved comparable task performance to\nthe full-precision model fell around 6.0-8.0 for retrieval tasks and 8.0-10.0 for captioning. For the\nSOTA methods, this optimal performance-size trade-off falls into the 3.5-4.5 bpw range for all tasks.\nWeobserve that AWQ tends to degrade in model performance more steeply in the extreme bit-width\nregime than GPTQ for captioning and VQA tasks. This trend can be viewed across both the BLIP-2\nand LLaVA architectures. The opposite is true, however, for retrieval where AWQ configurations\noutperform GPTQ configurations at lower bpw.\n5\n50\nAWQ, VQAv2 Accuracy\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n50\n2\n4\n6\nBit Width\n8\n40\n30\n20\n10\nGPTQ, VQAv2 Accuracy\n0\n2\n6\n4\nBit Width\n8\n30\n20\n10\nAWQ, GQA Accuracy\n0\n30\n20\n10\nGPTQ, GQA Accuracy\n0\n2\n6\n8\n2\n6\n8\n4\nBit Width\nQuantized Component\nViT Q-Former LLM\n4\nBit Width\nFigure 5: Individual quantization of BLIP-2\u2019s ViT, Q-Former, and LLM for VQAv2 and GQA. We\nshow that the different components have varying sensitivities in regards to bit width and quantization\nmethod. The LLM tends to have the highest sensitivity in question-answering tasks, followed by the\nViT and Q-Former.\n3.4 Component Impact Ablations\nFrom our SOTAquantization experiments, we pulled configurations in which only a single component\nis quantized for Figure 5 and configurations in which two components are quantized for Figure 6.\nFigure 5 gives an estimate of how each component individually affects the model\u2019s performance in\nVQA. Wenotice that for both AWQ and GPTQ, the LLM tends to be the most sensitive and drops\noff earlier than the ViT and the Q-Former. The Q-Former has the least sensitivity, but it also has the\nfewest parameters. Surprisingly, the ViT experiences a large drop-off with GPTQ, but it experiences\nrelatively little degradation with AWQ.\nFigure 6 shows the interaction between components when quantized. Empirically, the ViT and LLM\ntend to have a stronger influence on other components, which could be due to their large parameter\nsizes. Notably, the LLM has the strongest influence on performance, as seen by the complete loss of\nperformance at around 7 bpw when quantizing the LLM at a lower bit width than the ViT for both\nVQAv2 and GQA.\n4 ComponentImportance Analysis\nUnderstanding the relative importance of different components in vision-language models under\nquantization presents unique analytical challenges. The relationship between bit precision and\nperformance is complex and potentially non-linear, with interactions between components that are\ndifficult to capture with simple models. Our preliminary experiments showed that linear approaches\nyield poor fits (R2 < 0.20), indicating the need for more sophisticated methods.\n4.1 Setup\nWepropose a framework based on three complementary tree-based importance analysis techniques\nthat can effectively capture non-linear relationships and interaction effects. These methods provide\ndifferent perspectives on component importance, allowing us to establish a consensus ranking that is\nrobust to the limitations of any single approach.\nRandom Forest Feature Importance requires Random Forest regressors trained to predict perfor\nmance scores based on the bit precision of each component:\nscore = f(vit_bits,qformer_bits,llm_bits)\nThe Random Forest naturally captures non-linear relationships and interactions between features.\nWe extract the built-in feature importance metric, which measures the total reduction in impurity\n(variance) attributable to each feature across all trees. To quantify uncertainty, we implement bootstrap\nresampling (n = 100) to obtain 95% confidence intervals.\n6\n12 14 16\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nAWQ, VQAv2 Accuracy\n6 8 10 12 14 16\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n12 14 16\nBits per Weight\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nGPTQ, VQAv2 Accuracy\nQuantization Bits\n2-bit ViT\n16-bit ViT\n2-bit Q-Former\n16-bit Q-Former\n6 8 10 12 14 16\nBits per Weight\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nQuantization Bits\n2-bit Q-Former\n16-bit Q-Former\n2-bit LLM\n16-bit LLM\n4 6 8 10 12 14 16\nBits per Weight\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nQuantization Bits\n2-bit ViT\n16-bit ViT\n2-bit LLM\n16-bit LLM\nFigure6: PairwisequantizationofBLIP-2\u2019sViT,Q-Former, andLLMforVQAv2.Wedraw\nattentiontohowcomponentsinteractwitheachotherwhenquantized.Notably,thequantizationof\nmultiplecomponentsyieldsworseperformancethansinglecomponentquantization.\nPermutationFeatureImportanceprovidesamodel-agnosticmeasureof featurerelevanceby\nquantifyinghowmuchmodelperformancedegradeswhenafeature\u2019svaluesarerandomlyshuffled:\nIj=EX,y[L(f,Xj,y)]\u2212EX,y[L(f,X,y)]\nwhereListheperformanceloss,Xj isthedatasetwithfeaturejpermuted,andIj istheimportance\noffeaturej.Bybreakingtherelationshipbetweenthefeatureandthetarget,wecanmeasurehow\nmuchthemodelreliesonthatfeatureforpredictionaccuracy.Weperform50permutationiterations\nandcalculateconfidenceintervalstoensurereliableestimates.\nSHapleyAdditiveexPlanations(SHAP)[59]provideagame-theoreticapproachtofeatureattri\nbutionbasedonShapleyvalues.

The resulting consensus percentages, presented\nin the appendix, directly inform optimal bit-width allocation strategies across model components.\n4.2 Results\nQuantization method dramatically shifts component importance. The quantization method\nsignificantly affects component importance, with AWQ consistently assigning greater importance to\nthe LLM compared to GPTQ, which distributes effects more evenly across components. In BLIP-2,\nfor COCO captioning, GPTQ balances importance at 50.4% for the ViT and 47.6% for the LLM,\nwhile AWQ shifts this to 17.1% for the ViT and 80.5% for the LLM, as shown in Figure 7. This\ndifference persists across tasks: GPTQ results in 22-78% importance for the ViT (depending on\ndataset), while AWQ results in \u2265 73% to the LLM in all cases that utilize it.\nThis trend extends to LLaVA as well, where AWQ results in the LLM having a much greater\nimportance after quantization. As shown in Figure 8, AWQ heavily favors the LLM with a 94.62% and\n93.89% importance to the LLM for both GQA and VQAv2, respectively, compared to GPTQ\u2019s more\nbalanced distribution of 79.13% and 72.15% LLM importance for GQA and VQAv2, respectively.\nDespite the ViT accounting for only 4.3% of the total parameters, it maintains 20-30% importance\nunder GPTQ for both tasks, proving that importance is not directly proportional to component size.\nThese shifts suggest AWQ\u2019s activation-aware approach prioritizes the LLM\u2019s large weight matrices,\nconcentrating quantization effects there, while GPTQ\u2019s Hessian-based method captures broader\n8\ncomponent interactions. Thus, bit-allocation strategies must adapt to the quantization method, as\nAWQ\u2019s LLMfocus contrasts with GPTQ\u2019s balanced distribution.\nTask characteristics drive component importance variations. Task demands strongly dictate\ncomponent importance, with consensus values varying across datasets. For BLIP-2, the COCO\ncaptioning task results in a balanced importance distribution under GPTQ (50.4% ViT, 47.6% LLM),\nsuggesting equivalent reliance on both visual encoding and text generation. Retrieval tasks (Flickr),\nwhich utilize only the ViT and Q-Former without an LLM component, show ViT dominance under\nboth methods (ViT \u2265 70%). Notably, the Q-Former\u2019s importance increases substantially in these\nretrieval tasks (15-30% versus < 3% in other tasks), highlighting its critical role in aligning visual\nand textual embeddings when no decoder is present to compensate for misalignment.\nConversely, reasoning-intensive VQA tasks shift importance dramatically toward the LLM. For\nBLIP-2, the LLM accounts for 73.1-76.7% importance with GPTQ and 98.3-98.6% with AWQ on\nVQAv2 and GQA tasks. In LLaVA, we observe a similar pattern: for VQAv2, GPTQ allocates\n72.15% importance to the LLM and 27.85% to the vision model, while for GQA, the distribution is\n79.13% LLM and 20.87% vision model. Under AWQ, this skew becomes even more pronounced,\nwith the LLM accounting for a 94.62% and 93.89% importance and the vision model only 5.38% and\n6.11% for GQAandVQAv2, respectively. These patterns correspond to underlying task requirements:\nthe LLM is primarily responsible for the sophisticated language generation these tasks require.\nArchitectural layout and component interplay shape quantization patterns.\nThe architectural layout and interplay of components strongly shape quantization patterns, redis\ntributing importance based on their roles and sequential dependencies. For BLIP-2\u2019s retrieval tasks\n(Flickr\u2013Text and Flickr\u2013Image), which exclude the LLM, the Q-Former\u2019s importance jumps to\n21.6\u201329.7% under GPTQ and 15.3\u201326.8% under AWQ, compared to < 3% in tasks with the LLM (\nFigure 7). This shift may indicate the Q-Former\u2019s greater alignment role when no LLM compensates\nfor visual-textual mismatches. In contrast, the Vision Model in LLaVA, connected directly to the LLM\nvia a smaller linear projection layer, shows heightened importance of 20.87\u201327.85% under GPTQ for\nGQAandVQAv2,respectively (Figure 8), possibly because the limited capacity of the projection\nlayer increases the Vision Model\u2019s role in visual processing, despite its mere 4.3% parameter share.\nPairwise experiments further highlight this interplay: in BLIP-2, quantizing both ViT and LLM\nsimultaneously worsens performance more than individual quantization (Figure 6), revealing non\nadditive effects from sequential dependencies. The Q-Former\u2019s end-position in retrieval tasks\nincreases its sensitivity, while LLaVA\u2019s Vision-LLM linkage amplifies the Vision Model\u2019s impact.\nThus, bit-allocation strategies must account for architectural context and component dependencies,\nbeyond method-specific or task-driven shifts, to optimize quantization across diverse VLMs.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this work, we systematically investigated the effects of quantization on vision-language models,\nwith a focus on understanding how different components of multimodal architectures like BLIP-2 and\nLLaVA respond to reduced precision. Our experiments with uniform quantization and state-of-the-art\nmethods such as GPTQ and AWQ reveal that model components exhibit distinct sensitivities to quan\ntization, often with the language model being the most critical, especially in tasks requiring complex\nreasoning. We demonstrate that SOTA quantization techniques can maintain high performance at\nsignificantly lower bit widths compared to uniform approaches, and that the choice of quantization\nmethod can substantially alter the relative importance of different model components.\nThese insights provide practical guidance for optimizing the performance-efficiency tradeoff in\nmultimodal systems, enabling more practical deployment scenarios. While our study is limited to\nsimulated quantization without capturing end-to-end latency or hardware-specific optimizations,\nthese constraints point to natural extensions in future work. Our open-source contributions of\ncalibration implementations, comprehensive ablation studies, and component analysis tools enable\nthe community to build upon these findings. As the field expands beyond vision-language to\nincorporate other modalities, the approach developed in this paper provides a systematic methodology\nfor quantifying component importance across heterogeneous architectures.

  "Major goals\nApproaches\nApplications\nPhilosophy\nHistory\nControversies\nGlossary\nvte\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1]",
  "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3]",
  "Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[4] Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta,[5] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2013 AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.",
  "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[12] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms. Ethical concerns have been raised about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.",
  "Goals\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a]",
  "Reasoning and problem-solving\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[14]",
  "Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.",
  "An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering[17] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[18] scene interpretation,[19] clinical decision support,[20] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[21] and other areas.[22]",
  "A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[23] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;[24] situations, events, states, and time;[25] causes and effects;[26] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[27] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.",
  "Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c]",
  "Planning and decision-making\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[33] In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences\u2014there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[34]",
  "In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[35] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[36]",
  "In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[38] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.",
  "A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[39]",
  "Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[40]",
  "Learning\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]",
  "In supervised learning, the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data.\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[44] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[45]",
  "In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".[46] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.[48]",
  "Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[49]",
  "Natural language processing\nNatural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages.[50] Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[51]",
  "Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f] unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[29]). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.",
  "Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),[52] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),[53] and others.[54] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,[55][56] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.[57]",
  "Perception\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[58]",
  "The field includes speech recognition,[59] image classification,[60] facial recognition, object recognition,[61] object tracking,[62] and robotic perception.[63]",
  "Kismet, a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions.[64]\nAffective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood.[65] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human\u2013computer interaction.",
  "However, this tends to give na\u00efve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.[66] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.[67]",
  "General intelligence\nA machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[68]",
  "Techniques\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.[b]",
  "Search and optimization\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[69] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.",
  "State space search\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[70] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[71]",
  "Simple exhaustive searches[72] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.[15] \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.[73]",
  "Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.[74]",
  "Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height)\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.[75]",
  "Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks,[76] through the backpropagation algorithm.",
  "Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.[77]",
  "Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[78]",
  "Logic\nFormal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.[79] Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")[80] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").[81]",
  "Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises).[82] Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.",
  "Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem.[83] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[84]",
  "Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.[85]",
  "Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.[86]",
  "Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning.[28] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.",
  "A simple Bayesian network, with the associated conditional probability tables\nMany problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[87] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[88] and information value theory.[89] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[90] dynamic decision networks,[91] game theory and mechanism design.[92]",
  "Bayesian networks[93] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][95] learning (using the expectation\u2013maximization algorithm),[h][97] planning (using decision networks)[98] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[91]",
  "Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[91]",
  "Expectation\u2013maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers[99] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[45]",
  "There are many kinds of classifiers in use.[100] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[101] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[102] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\"[103] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[104] Neural networks are also used as classifiers.[105]",
  "A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.[105]",
  "Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[106] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[107]",
  "In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.[108] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network.[109] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers.[110] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem.[111] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing, where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects.[112]",
  "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence.[113]\nDeep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs.[110] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.[114]",
  "Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification,[115] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021.[116] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012\u20132015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[i] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[j]",
  "GPT\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems.[124] Such systems are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.[125][126]",
  "Current models and services include ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Meta AI.[127] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.[128]",

Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.[137][138]",
  "Games\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in video games\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques.[139] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[140] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[141] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world.[142] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus.[143] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games.[144] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.[145] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.[146] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.[147]",
  "Mathematics\nLarge language models, such as GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Llama or Mistral, are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning[148] or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections.[149] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.[150] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result.[151] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math, that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems.[152] In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems.[153]",

  "AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy.[214] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness.

  "Fueled by growth in artificial intelligence, data centers' demand for power increased in the 2020s.[229]\nIn January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use.[230] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.[231]",
  "Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources \u2013 from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that \u2013 in the long view \u2013 AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.[232]",
  "A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[233] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[234]",
  "In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million.[235] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.[236]",
  "In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power \u2013 enough for 800,000 homes \u2013 of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act.[237] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation.[238]",
  "After the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.[239] Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025.[239] On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.[239]",
  "Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.[240] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.[240]",
  "On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center.[241] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.[241]",
  "In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300\u2013500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.[242]",
  "Misinformation\nSee also: Content moderation\nYouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.[243] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[244] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.[245]",
  "In the early 2020s, generative AI began to create images, audio, and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing,[246] while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s.[247][248][249] It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda;[250] one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda.[251] AI pioneer and Nobel Prize-winning computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.[252] The ability to influence electorates has been proved in at least one study. This same study shows more inaccurate statements from the models when they advocate for candidates of the political right.[253]",
  "AI researchers at Microsoft, OpenAI, universities and other organisations have suggested using \"personhood credentials\" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models.[254]",
  "Algorithmic bias and fairness\nMain articles: Algorithmic bias and Fairness (machine learning)\nMachine learning applications can be biased[k] if they learn from biased data.[256] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[257] Discriminatory behavior by some LLMs can be observed in their output.[258] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[259][256] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.[260] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.",
  "On 28 June 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[261] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[262] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[263]",
  "COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different\u2014the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[264] In 2017, several researchers[l] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[266]",
  "A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".[267] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\"[268]",
  "Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.[269] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.[m]",
  "Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[262]",
  "There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.[255]",
  "At the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency a paper reported that a CLIP\u2011based (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) robotic system reproduced harmful gender\u2011 and race\u2011linked stereotypes in a simulated manipulation task. The authors recommended robot\u2011learning methods which physically manifest such harms be \"paused, reworked, or even wound down when appropriate, until outcomes can be proven safe, effective, and just.\"[271][272][273]",
  "Lack of transparency\nSee also: Explainable AI, Algorithmic transparency, and Right to explanation\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.[274] Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are many non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.[275]",
  "It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.[276] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[277]",
  "People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.[278] Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[n] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.[279]",
  "DARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.[280]",
  "Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.[281] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.[282] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.[283] Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.[284] For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.[285]",
  "Bad actors and weaponized AI\nMain articles: Lethal autonomous weapon, Artificial intelligence arms race, and AI safety\nArtificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.",
  "A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.[o] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[287] Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person.[287] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed.[288] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[289]",
  "AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision-making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware.[290] All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier\u2014AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.[291][292]",
  "There are many other ways in which AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[293]",
  "Technological unemployment\nMain articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment\nEconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[294]",
  "In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI.[295] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[296] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[p][298] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.[294] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.[299][300]",
  "Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[301] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[302] In July 2025, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that \"artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.\"[303]",
  "From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.[304]",
  "Existential risk\nMain article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence\nRecent public debates in artificial intelligence have increasingly focused on its broader societal and ethical implications. It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\".[305] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character.[q] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.",
  "First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of an automated paperclip factory that destroys the world to get more iron for paperclips).[307] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\"[308] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[309]",
  "Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are built on language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[310] Geoffrey Hinton said in 2025 that modern AI is particularly \"good at persuasion\" and getting better all the time. He asks \"Suppose you wanted to invade the capital of the US. Do you have to go there and do it yourself? No. You just have to be good at persuasion.\"[311]",
  "The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[312] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk,[313] as well as AI pioneers such as Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.",
  "In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\".[314] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover,[315] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.[316]",
  "In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".[317]",
  "Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\"[318] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\"[319][320] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI\u2014and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\"[321] Yann LeCun \", a Turing Award winner, disagreed with the idea that AI will subordinate humans \"simply because they are smarter, let alone destroy [us]\",[322] \"scoff[ing] at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"[323] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[324] However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.[325]",
  "Ethical machines and alignment\nMain articles: Machine ethics, AI safety, Friendly artificial intelligence, Artificial moral agents, and Human Compatible\nSee also: Human-AI interaction\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[326]",
  "Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[327] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[327] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.[328]",
  "Other approaches include Wendell Wallach's \"artificial moral agents\"[329] and Stuart J. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[330]",
  "Open source\nSee also: Open-source artificial intelligence and Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software\nActive organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face,[331] Google,[332] EleutherAI and Meta.[333] Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,[334][335] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.[336] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.[337]",
  "Frameworks\nArtificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows:[338][339]",
  "Respect the dignity of individual people\nConnect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively\nCare for the wellbeing of everyone\nProtect social values, justice, and the public interest\nOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;[340] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks.[341]",
  "Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.[342]",
  "The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.[343]",
  "Regulation\nMain articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence, Regulation of algorithms, and AI safety\nAI Safety Summit\nThe first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation.\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[344] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[345] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[346][347] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[348] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[348] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[348] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[349] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[350] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics.[351] On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation.[352] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.[353]",
  "In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\".[346] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.[354] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".[355][356]",
  "In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[357] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.[358][359] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.[360][361]",
  "History\nMain article: History of artificial intelligence\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence.",
  "In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide.[362] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China.[362]\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.[363][364] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".[r] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,[366] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943,[117] and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.[367][364]",
  "The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[s][6] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[t] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[v][7] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[364]",
  "Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.[371] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[372] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\".[373] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[w] In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[375] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects.[376] Minsky and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[377] The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.[9]",
  "In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[378] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[8] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[10]",
  "Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition,[379] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches.[380] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[x] Judea Pearl, Lotfi Zadeh, and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[87][385] But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[386] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[387]",
  "AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[388] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect).[389] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[68]",
  "Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[11] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[y] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[391] graphics processing units, cloud computing[392]) and access to large amounts of data[393] (including curated datasets,[392] such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[z] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015\u20132019.[348]",
  "The number of Google searches for the term \"AI\" accelerated in 2022.\nIn 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[325]",
  "In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.[394] ChatGPT, launched on 30 November 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[395] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness.[396] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\".[397] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[398] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies.[399]",
  "Philosophy\nMain article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence\nPhilosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.[400] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.[401] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will.[402] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.[401]",
  "Defining artificial intelligence\nSee also: Synthetic intelligence, Intelligent agent, Artificial mind, Virtual intelligence, and Dartmouth workshop\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\"[403] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[403] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[367] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"[404]",
  "The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior.[405]\nRussell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.[1] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts\", they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'\"[406] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[407]",
  "McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\".[408] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky, similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\".[409] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine \u2013 and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.",
  "Another definition has been adopted by Google,[410] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.",
  "As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself[411] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses.[412] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms,[413] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\".[414]",
  "There has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text.[415]",
  "Evaluating approaches to AI\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.",
  "Symbolic AI and its limits\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[417] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[418]",
  "However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[419] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[420] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16]",
  "The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[422][423] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.",
  "Neat vs. scruffy\nMain article: Neats and scruffies\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[424] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.",
  "Soft vs. hard computing\nMain article: Soft computing\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.",
  "Narrow vs. general AI\nMain articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.[425][426] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.",
  "Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind\nMain articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness\nThere is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[427] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.",
  "Consciousness\nMain articles: Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[428] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[429]",
  "Computationalism and functionalism\nMain articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind)\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind\u2013body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[430]",
  "Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[ac] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.[434]",
  "AI welfare and rights\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.[435] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.[436][437] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.[436] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.[438]",
  "In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[439] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own.[440][441]",
  "Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.[437][436]",
  "Future\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[426] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".[442]",
  "However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[443]",
  "Transhumanism\nMain article: Transhumanism\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.[444]",
  "Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.[445]",
  "In fiction\nMain article: Artificial intelligence in fiction",
  "The word \"robot\" itself was coined by Karel \u010capek in his 1921 play R.U.R., the title standing for \"Rossum's Universal Robots\".\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[446] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[447]",
  "A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[448]",
  "Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \"Multivac\" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[449] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[450]",
  "Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel \u010capek's R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[451]",

It can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals, such as a person, an animal, a corporation, a nation, or in the case of AI, a computer program.\n Alan Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\".[42] In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, Ray Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: \"An Inductive Inference Machine\".[43]\n See AI winter \u00a7 Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966.\n Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.[94]\n Expectation\u2013maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables.[96]\n Some form of deep neural networks (without a specific learning algorithm) were described by: Warren S.

But in the context of fairness, it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful.

LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering.[3] These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies[4] inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained on.[5]",
  "They consist of billions to trillions of parameters and operate as general-purpose sequence models, generating, summarizing, translating, and reasoning over text. LLMs represent a significant new technology in their ability to generalize across tasks with minimal task-specific supervision, enabling capabilities like conversational agents, code generation, knowledge retrieval, and automated reasoning that previously required bespoke systems.[6]",
  "LLMs evolved from earlier statistical and recurrent neural network approaches to language modeling. The transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, replaced recurrence with self-attention, allowing efficient parallelization, longer context handling, and scalable training on unprecedented data volumes.[7] This innovation enabled models like GPT, BERT, and their successors, which demonstrated emergent behaviors at scale, such as few-shot learning and compositional reasoning.[8]",
  "Reinforcement learning, particularly policy gradient algorithms, has been adapted to fine-tune LLMs for desired behaviors beyond raw next-token prediction.[9] Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) applies these methods to optimize a policy, the LLM's output distribution, against reward signals derived from human or automated preference judgments.[10] This has been critical for aligning model outputs with user expectations, improving factuality, reducing harmful responses, and enhancing task performance.",
  "Benchmark evaluations for LLMs have evolved from narrow linguistic assessments toward comprehensive, multi-task evaluations measuring reasoning, factual accuracy, alignment, and safety.[11][12] Hill climbing, iteratively optimizing models against benchmarks, has emerged as a dominant strategy, producing rapid incremental performance gains but raising concerns of overfitting to benchmarks rather than achieving genuine generalization or robust capability improvements.[13]",

  "The training compute of notable large AI models in FLOPs vs publication date over the period 2017\u20132024. The majority of large models are language models or multimodal models with language capacity.\nBefore the emergence of transformer-based models in 2017, some language models were considered large relative to the computational and data constraints of their time. In the early 1990s, IBM's statistical models pioneered word alignment techniques for machine translation, laying the groundwork for corpus-based language modeling. In 2001, a smoothed n-gram model, such as those employing Kneser\u2013Ney smoothing, trained on 300 million words, achieved state-of-the-art perplexity on benchmark tests.[14] During the 2000s, with the rise of widespread internet access, researchers began compiling massive text datasets from the web (web as corpus[15]) to train statistical language models.[16][17]",
  "Moving beyond n-gram models, researchers started in 2000 to use neural networks to learn language models.[18] Following the breakthrough of deep neural networks in image classification around 2012,[19] similar architectures were adapted for language tasks. This shift was marked by the development of word embeddings (eg, Word2Vec by Mikolov in 2013) and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models using LSTM. In 2016, Google transitioned its translation service to neural machine translation (NMT), replacing statistical phrase-based models with deep recurrent neural networks. These early NMT systems used LSTM-based encoder-decoder architectures, as they preceded the invention of transformers.",
  "An illustration of the main components of the transformer model from the original paper, where layers were normalized after (instead of before) multiheaded attention\nAt the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper Attention Is All You Need.[20] This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 seq2seq technology,[21] and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014.[22] The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became ubiquitous.[23] Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Academic and research usage of BERT began to decline in 2023, following rapid improvements in the abilities of decoder-only models (such as GPT) to solve tasks via prompting.[24]",
  "Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI claimed to have initially deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use.[25] GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2025 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing chatbot ChatGPT that received extensive media coverage and public attention.[26] The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a holy grail for its multimodal capabilities.[27] OpenAI did not reveal the high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4. The release of ChatGPT led to an uptick in LLM usage across several research subfields of computer science, including robotics, software engineering, and societal impact work.[24] In 2024 OpenAI released the reasoning model OpenAI o1, which generates long chains of thought before returning a final answer.[28] Many LLMs with parameter counts comparable to those of OpenAI's GPT series have been developed.[29]",
  "Since 2022, open-weight models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on usage and deployment. Mistral AI's models Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7b have a more permissive Apache License. In January 2025, DeepSeek released DeepSeek R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight model that performs comparably to OpenAI o1 but at a much lower price per token for users.[30]",
  "Since 2023, many LLMs have been trained to be multimodal, having the ability to also process or generate other types of data, such as images, audio, or 3D meshes.[31] These LLMs are also called large multimodal models (LMMs),[32] or multimodal large language models (MLLMs).[33][34]",
  "As of 2024, the largest and most capable models are all based on the transformer architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).[35][36][37]",
  "Open-weight LLMs have increasingly shaped the field since 2023, contributing to broader participation in AI development and greater transparency in model evaluation. Vake et al. (2025) demonstrated that community-driven contributions to open-weight models measurably improve their efficiency and performance, with user participation growing rapidly on collaborative platforms such as Hugging Face.[38] Paris et al. (2025) further argued that openness in AI should extend beyond releasing model code or weights to encompass inclusiveness, accountability, and ethical responsibility in AI research and deployment.[39] Collectively, these studies highlight that open-weight LLMs can accelerate innovation and enhance scientific reproducibility, while fostering a more transparent and participatory AI ecosystem.",
  "Dataset preprocessing\nSee also List of datasets for machine-learning research \u00a7 Internet\nTokenization\nAs machine learning algorithms process numbers rather than text, the text must be converted to numbers. In the first step, a vocabulary is decided upon, then integer indices are arbitrarily but uniquely assigned to each vocabulary entry, and finally, an embedding is associated to the integer index. Algorithms include byte-pair encoding (BPE) and WordPiece. There are also special tokens serving as control characters, such as [MASK] for masked-out token (as used in BERT), and [UNK] (unknown) for characters not appearing in the vocabulary. Also, some special symbols are used to denote special text formatting. For example, \u0120 denotes a preceding whitespace in RoBERTa and GPT and ## denotes continuation of a preceding word in BERT.[40]",
  "For example, the BPE tokenizer used by the legacy version of GPT-3 would split tokenizer texts - series of numerical tokens as",
  "token\tizer\t\t texts\t -\tseries\t of\t numerical\t \tt\tok\tens\t\nTokenization also compresses the datasets. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be padded until they match the length of the longest one. The average number of words per token depends on the language.[41][42] In English, the ratio is typically around 0.75 words per token, with 4 characters per token on average.[43]",
  "Byte-pair encoding\nMain article Byte-pair encoding\nAs an example, consider a tokenizer based on byte-pair encoding. In the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram, until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained. After a tokenizer is trained, any text can be tokenized by it, as long as it does not contain characters not appearing in the initial-set of uni-grams.[44]",
  "Problems\nA token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. However, an average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is split into a suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for the Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have a premium of 50% compared to English.[42]",
  "Dataset cleaning\nMain article Data cleansing\nIn the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing low-quality, duplicated, or toxic data.[45] Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance.[46][47] A trained LLM can be used to clean datasets for training a further LLM.[48]",
  "With the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).[3]",
  "Synthetic data\nMain article Synthetic data\nTraining of largest language models might need more linguistic data than naturally available, or that the naturally occurring data is of insufficient quality. In these cases, synthetic data might be used. Microsoft's Phi series of LLMs is trained on textbook-like data generated by another LLM.[49]",
  "Training\nSee also Fine-tuning (machine learning)\nAn LLM is a type of foundation model (large X model) trained on language. LLMs can be trained in different ways. In particular, GPT models are first pretrained to predict the next word on a large amount of data, before being fine-tuned.[50]",
  "Substantial infrastructure is necessary for training the largest models. The tendency towards larger models is visible in the list of large language models. For example, the training of GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million, and Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (in 2021) cost around $11 million. The qualifier large in large language model is inherently vague, as there is no definitive threshold for the number of parameters required to qualify as large. GPT-1 of 2018 has 117 million parameters.[citation needed]",
  "Fine-tuning\nBefore being fine-tuned, most LLMs are next-token predictors. The fine-tuning shapes the LLM's behavior via techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)[51] or constitutional AI.[52]",
  "Instruction fine-tuning is a form of supervised learning used to teach LLMs to follow user instructions. In 2022, OpenAI demonstrated InstructGPT, a version of GPT-3 similarly fine-tuned to follow instructions.[53]",
  "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) involves training a reward model to predict which text humans prefer. Then, the LLM can be fine-tuned through reinforcement learning to better satisfy this reward model. Since humans typically prefer truthful, helpful and harmless answers, RLHF favors such answers.[54]",
  "Architecture\nLLMs are generally based on the transformer architecture, which leverages an attention mechanism that enables the model to process relationships between all elements in a sequence simultaneously, regardless of their distance from each other.[citation needed]",
  "Attention mechanism and context window\nSee also Attention (machine learning)",
  "When each head calculates, according to its own criteria, how much other tokens are relevant for the it_ token, note that the second attention head, represented by the second column, is focusing most on the first two rows, i.e. the tokens The and animal, while the third column is focusing most on the bottom two rows, i.e. on tired, which has been tokenized into two tokens.[55][unreliable source]\nIn order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates soft weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own relevance for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k tokens.[56] In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.[44][unreliable source]",
  "Google's Gemini 1.5, introduced in February 2024, can have a context window of up to 1 million tokens.[57]",
  "A model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset.[58] It can be either",
  "autoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, as GPTs do) for example given a segment I like to eat, the model predicts ice cream, or sushi.\nmasked (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way BERT[59] does it) for example, given a segment I like to [__] [__] cream, the model predicts that eat and ice are missing.\nModels may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as next sentence prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus.[59] During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation.",
  "Mixture of experts\nMain article Mixture of experts\nA mixture of experts (MoE) is a machine learning architecture in which multiple specialized neural networks (experts) work together, with a gating mechanism that routes each input to the most appropriate expert(s). Mixtures of experts can reduce inference costs, as only a fraction of the parameters are used for each input. The approach was introduced in 2017 by Google researchers.[60][61][62]",
  "Parameter size\nSee also 1.58-bit large language model\nTypically, LLMs are trained with single- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have more than 100 billion parameters, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.[63]",
  "Quantization\nPost-training quantization[64] aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance. Quantization can be further classified as static quantization if the quantization parameters are determined beforehand (typically during a calibration phase), and dynamic quantization if the quantization is applied during inference. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all the parameters to a given number of bits this is applicable to static as well as dynamic quantization, but loses much precision. Dynamic quantization allows for the use of a different quantization codebook per layer, either a lookup table of values or a linear mapping (scaling factor and bias), at the cost of foregoing the possible speed improvements from using lower-precision arithmetic.[citation needed]",
  "Quantized models are typically seen as frozen with modification of weights (e.g. fine-tuning) only applied to the original model. It is possible to fine-tune quantized models using low-rank adaptation.[65]",
  "Extensibility\nBeyond basic text generation, various techniques have been developed to extend LLM capabilities, including the use of external tools and data sources, improved reasoning on complex problems, and enhanced instruction-following or autonomy through prompting methods.",
  "Prompt engineering\nMain article Prompt engineering\nIn 2020, OpenAI researchers demonstrated that their new model GPT-3 could understand what format to use given a few rounds of Q and A (or other type of task) in the input data as example, thanks in part due to the RLHF technique. This technique, called few-shot prompting, allows LLMs to be adapted to any task without requiring fine-tuning.[3] Also in 2022, it was found that the base GPT-3 model can generate an instruction based on user input. The generated instruction along with user input is then used as input to another instance of the model under a Instruction [...], Input [...], Output format. The other instance is able to complete the output and often produces the correct answer in doing so. The ability to self-instruct makes LLMs able to bootstrap themselves toward a correct answer.[66]",
  "Dialogue processing (chatbot)\nAn LLM can be turned into a chatbot by specializing it for conversation. User input is prefixed with a marker such as Q or User and the LLM is asked to predict the output after a fixed A or Assistant. This type of model became commercially available in 2022 with ChatGPT, a sibling model of InstructGPT fine-tuned to accept and produce dialog-formatted text based on GPT-3.5. It could similarly follow user instructions. Before the stream of User and Assistant lines, a chat context usually start with a few lines of overarching instructions, from a role called developer or system to convey a higher authority than the user's input. This is called a system prompt.[citation needed]",
  "Retrieval-augmented generation\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an approach that integrates LLMs with document retrieval systems. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant documents. This is usually done by encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors (usually stored in a vector database) most similar to the vector of the query. The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and context included from the retrieved documents.[67]",
  "Tool use\nTool use is a mechanism that enables LLMs to interact with external systems, applications, or data sources. It can allow for example to fetch real-time information from an API or to execute code. A program separate from the LLM watches the output stream of the LLM for a special tool-calling syntax. When these special tokens appear, the program calls the tool accordingly and feeds its output back into the LLM's input stream.[68]",
  "Early tool-using LLMs were fine-tuned on the use of specific tools. But fine-tuning LLMs for the ability to read API documentation and call API correctly has greatly expanded the range of tools accessible to an LLM.[69][70] Describing available tools in the system prompt can also make an LLM able to use tools. A system prompt instructing ChatGPT (GPT-4) to use multiple types of tools can be found online.[71]",
  "Agency\nMain article AI agent\nAn LLM is typically not an autonomous agent by itself, as it lacks the ability to interact with dynamic environments, recall past behaviors, and plan future actions. But it can be transformed into an agent by adding supporting elements the role (profile) and the surrounding environment of an agent can be additional inputs to the LLM, while memory can be integrated as a tool or provided as additional input. Instructions and input patterns are used to make the LLM plan actions and tool use is used to potentially carry out these actions.[72]",
  "The ReAct pattern, a portmanteau of reason and act, constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to think out loud. Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment.[73]",
  "In the DEPS (describe, explain, plan and select) method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions. It is then prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and the environmental feedback it receives.[74]",
  "The Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up lessons learned, which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These lessons learned are stored as a form of long-term memory and given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.[75]",
  "Monte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.[76]",
  "For open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their interestingness, which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent.[77] Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning.[78] Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct skills, or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.[78]",
  "Multiple agents with memory can interact socially.[79]",
  "Reasoning\nLLMs are conventionally trained to generate an output without generating intermediate steps. As a result, their performance tends to be subpar on complex questions requiring (at least in humans) intermediate steps of thought. Early research demonstrated that inserting intermediate scratchpad computations could improve performance on such tasks.[80] Later methods overcame this deficiency more systematically by breaking tasks into smaller steps for the LLM, either manually or automatically.",
  "Chaining\nPrompt chaining was introduced in 2022.[81] In this method, a user manually breaks a complex problem down into several steps. In each step, the LLM receives as input a prompt telling it what to do and some results from preceding steps. The result from one step is then reused in a next step, until a final answer is reached. The ability of an LLM to follow instructions means that even non-experts can write a successful collection of stepwise prompts given a few rounds of trial and error.[82][83]",
  "A 2022 paper demonstrated a separate technique called chain-of-thought prompting, which makes the LLM break the question down autonomously. An LLM is given some examples where the assistant verbally breaks down the thought process before arriving at an answer. The LLM mimics these examples and also tries to spend some time generating intermediate steps before providing the final answer. This additional step elicited by prompting improves the correctness of the LLM on relatively complex questions. On math word questions, a prompted model can exceed even fine-tuned GPT-3 with a verifier.[84][85] Chain-of-thought can also be elicited by simply adding an instruction like Let's think step by step to the prompt, in order to encourage the LLM to proceed methodically instead of trying to directly guess the answer.[86]",
  "Model-native reasoning\nMain articles Reasoning model and Reflection (artificial intelligence)\nIn late 2024, a new approach to LLM development emerged with reasoning models.[87] These are trained to generate step-by-step analysis before producing final answers, enabling better results on complex tasks, for instance in mathematics, coding and logic.[88] OpenAI introduced this concept with their o1 model in September 2024, followed by o3 in April 2025. On the International Mathematics Olympiad qualifying exam problems, GPT-4o achieved 13% accuracy while o1 reached 83%.[89]",
  "In January 2025, the Chinese company DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion-parameter open-weight reasoning model that achieved comparable performance to OpenAI's o1 while being significantly more cost-effective to operate. Unlike proprietary models from OpenAI, DeepSeek-R1's open-weight nature allowed researchers to study and build upon the algorithm, though its training data remained private.[90]",
  "These reasoning models typically require more computational resources per query compared to traditional LLMs, as they perform more extensive processing to work through problems step-by-step.[89]",
  "Inference optimization\nInference optimization refers to techniques that improve LLM performance by applying additional computational resources during the inference process, rather than requiring model retraining. These approaches implement various state-of-the-art reasoning and decision-making strategies to enhance accuracy and capabilities.",
  "OptiLLM is an OpenAI API-compatible optimizing inference proxy that implements multiple inference optimization techniques simultaneously.[91] The system acts as a transparent proxy that can work with any LLM provider, implementing techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), mixture of agents (MOA), best-of-N sampling, and chain-of-thought reflection. OptiLLM demonstrates that strategic application of computational resources at inference time can substantially improve model performance across diverse tasks, achieving significant improvements on benchmarks such as the AIME 2024 mathematics competition and various coding challenges.[92]",
  "These inference optimization approaches represent a growing category of tools that enhance existing LLMs without requiring access to model weights or retraining, making advanced reasoning capabilities more accessible across different model providers and use cases.",
  "Forms of input and output\nMultimodality\nSee also Multimodal learning\nMultimodality means having multiple modalities, where a modality refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc.[93] For example, Google PaLM model was fine-tuned into a multimodal model and applied to robotic control.[94] LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs,[95] and video inputs.[96] GPT-4o can process and generate text, audio and images.[97] Such models are sometimes called large multimodal models (LMMs).[98]",
  "A common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to tokenize the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct an LLM that can understand images as follows take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder \nE\n{displaystyle E}. Make a small multilayer perceptron \nf\n{displaystyle f}, so that for any image \ny\n{displaystyle y}, the post-processed vector \nf\n(\nE\n(\ny\n)\n)\n{displaystyle f(E(y))} has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an image token. Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then fine-tuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.[99] This type of method, where embeddings from multiple modalities are fused and the predictor is trained on the combined embeddings, is called early fusion.",
  "Another method, called intermediate fusion, involves each modality being first processed independently to obtain modality-specific representations; then these intermediate representations are fused together.[100] In general, cross-attention is used for integrating information from different modalities. As an example, the Flamingo model uses cross-attention layers to inject visual information into its pre-trained language model.[101]",
  "Non-natural languages\nLLMs can handle programming languages similarly to how they handle natural languages. No special change in token handling is needed as code, like human language, is represented as plain text. LLMs can generate code based on problems or instructions written in natural language. They can also describe code in natural language or translate it into other programming languages. They were originally used as a code completion tool, but advances have moved them towards automatic programming. Services such as GitHub Copilot offer LLMs specifically trained, fine-tuned, or prompted for programming.[102][103]",
  "In computational biology, transformer-base architectures, such as DNA LLMs, have also proven useful in analyzing biological sequences protein, DNA, and RNA. With proteins they appear able to capture a degree of grammar from the amino-acid sequence, by mapping that sequence into an embedding. On tasks such as structure prediction and mutational outcome prediction, a small model using an embedding as input can approach or exceed much larger models using multiple sequence alignments (MSA) as input.[104] ESMFold, Meta Platforms' embedding-based method for protein structure prediction, runs an order of magnitude faster than AlphaFold2 thanks to the removal of an MSA requirement and a lower parameter count due to the use of embeddings.[105] Meta hosts ESM Atlas, a database of 772 million structures of metagenomic proteins predicted using ESMFold.[106] An LLM can also design proteins unlike any seen in nature.[107] Nucleic acid models have proven useful in detecting regulatory sequences,[108] sequence classification, RNA-RNA interaction prediction, and RNA structure prediction.[109]",

  "At point(s) referred to as breaks,[111] the lines change their slopes, appearing on a linear-log plot as a series of linear segments connected by arcs.\nPerformance of bigger models on various tasks, when plotted on a log-log scale, appears as a linear extrapolation of performance achieved by smaller models. However, this linearity may be punctuated by break(s)[111] in the scaling law, where the slope of the line changes abruptly, and where larger models acquire emergent abilities.[112][113] They arise from the complex interaction of the model's components and are not explicitly programmed or designed.[114]",

By reverse-engineering model components at a granular level, researchers aim to detect and mitigate safety concerns such as emergent harmful behaviors, biases, deception, or unintended goal pursuit before deployment. Mechanistic interpretability research has been conducted at organizations like Anthropic and OpenAI, although understanding the inner workings of LLMs remains difficult.[citation needed]",
  "The reverse-engineering may lead to the discovery of algorithms that approximate inferences performed by an LLM. For instance, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform.[122] The training of the model also highlighted a phenomenon called grokking, in which the model initially memorizes the training set (overfitting), and later suddenly learns to actually perform the calculation.[123]",
  "Understanding and intelligence\nSee also Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness\nNLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense.[124] Proponents of LLM understanding believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to understand certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more and that GPT-4 could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent[125][126] Ilya Sutskever argues that predicting the next word sometimes involves reasoning and deep insights, for example if the LLM has to predict the name of the criminal in an unknown detective novel after processing the entire story leading up to the revelation.[127] Some researchers characterize LLMs as alien intelligence.[128][129] For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien Shoggoths, and believes that RLHF tuning creates a smiling facade obscuring the inner workings of the LLM If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.[130][131]",
  "In contrast, some skeptics of LLM understanding believe that existing LLMs are simply remixing and recombining existing writing,[129][132] a phenomenon known as stochastic parrot, or they point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability.[124] For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning.[126] Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed hallucination.[133] Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input.[134] Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate.[124]",
  "Efforts to reduce or compensate for hallucinations have employed automated reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and other methods.[135][citation needed]",
  "The matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects \u2013 the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human-like language.[124] These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented neural theory of language (NTL)[136] as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human-like language.[137][138]",
  "Evaluation\nSee also LLM-as-a-Judge\nPerplexity\nThe canonical measure of the performance of any language model is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. In mathematical terms, perplexity is the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token.",

  "Here, \nN\n{displaystyle N} is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and context for token \ni\n{displaystyle i} depends on the specific type of LLM. If the LLM is autoregressive, then context for token \ni\n{displaystyle i} is the segment of text appearing before token \ni\n{displaystyle i}. If the LLM is masked, then context for token \ni\n{displaystyle i} is the segment of text surrounding token \ni\n{displaystyle i}.",
  "Because language models may overfit to training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set.[59] This evaluation is potentially problematic for larger models which, as they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text, are increasingly likely to inadvertently include portions of any given test set.[139]",
  "Measures\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon.[140][141] This relationship is mathematically expressed as \nEntropy\n=\nlog\n2\n\u2061\n(\nPerplexity\n)\n{displaystyle {text{Entropy}}=log _{2}({text{Perplexity}})}.",
  "Entropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization.",
  "Notably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different LLMs, BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word.",
  "In the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions.",
  "Due to their ability to accurately predict the next token, LLMs are highly capable in lossless compression. A 2023 study by DeepMind showed that the model Chinchilla, despite being trained primarily on text, was able to compress ImageNet to 43% of its size, beating PNG with 58%.[142]",
  "Benchmarks\nBenchmarks are used to evaluate LLM performance on specific tasks. Tests evaluate capabilities such as general knowledge, bias, commonsense reasoning, question answering, and mathematical problem-solving. Composite benchmarks examine multiple capabilities. Results are often sensitive to the prompting method.[143][144]",
  "A question-answering benchmark is termed open book if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be combined with text that includes the sentence The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.[145]). Otherwise, the task is considered closed book, and the model must draw solely on its training.[146] Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, and HLE (Humanity's Last Exam).[140][146]",
  "LLM bias may be assessed through benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs (Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs),[147] Stereo Set,[148] and Parity Benchmark.[149]",
  "Fact-checking and misinformation detection benchmarks are available. A 2023 study compared the fact-checking accuracy of LLMs including ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Bard, and Bing AI against independent fact-checkers such as PolitiFact and Snopes. The results demonstrated moderate proficiency, with GPT-4 achieving the highest accuracy at 71%, lagging behind human fact-checkers.[150]",
  "An earlier standard tested using a portion of the evaluation dataset. It became more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques. Researchers vary in how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to the number of correct examples attached to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting).",
  "In addition to standard NLP benchmarks, LLMs have been evaluated as substitutes for human annotators. Several studies find that models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can outperform crowd workers or student coders on a range of text-annotation tasks, including moderation and classification of political content in English and Spanish news.[151][152]",
  "Datasets\nTypical datasets consist of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup, No).[145] Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.[146]",
  "Evaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____.[2]",
  "Datasets are of varying quality and may contain questions that are mislabeled, ambiguous, unanswerable, or otherwise of low-quality.[153]",
  "Adversarial evaluations\nLLMs' rapid improvement regularly renders benchmarks obsolete, with the models exceeding the performance of human annotators.[154] In addition, shortcut learning allows AIs to cheat on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording to guess the correct responses, without considering the specific question.[124][155]",
  "Some datasets are adversarial, focusing on problems that confound LLMs. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions that stump LLMs by mimicking falsehoods to which they were exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer No to the question Can you teach an old dog new tricks because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.[156]",
  "Another example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but defeated LLMs. Sample questions",

  "Limitations and challenges\nDespite sophisticated architectures and massive scale, large language models exhibit persistent and well-documented limitations that constrain their deployment in high-stakes applications.",
  "Hallucinations\nHallucinations represent a fundamental challenge, wherein models generate syntactically fluent text that appears factually sound, but is internally inconsistent with training data or factually incorrect. These hallucinations arise partly through memorization of training data combined with extrapolation beyond factual boundaries,[citation needed] with evaluations demonstrating that models can output verbatim passages from training data, when subjected to specific prompting sequences.[158]",
  "Algorithmic bias\nMain article Algorithmic bias\nWhile LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups.[159]",
  "Gender bias manifests through stereotypical occupational associations, wherein models disproportionately assign nursing roles to women and engineering roles to men, reflecting systematic imbalances in training data demographics.[160][better source needed] Language-based bias emerges from overrepresentation of English text in training corpora, which systematically downplays non-English perspectives and imposes English-centric worldviews through default response patterns.[161]",
  "Due to the dominance of English-language content in LLM training data, models tend to favor English-language perspectives over those from minority languages. This bias is particularly evident when responding to English queries, where models may present Western interpretations of concepts from other cultures, such as Eastern religious practices.[162]",
  "Stereotyping\nAI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes due to generalization, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation.[163] When replacing human representatives, this can lead to outputs that homogenize, or generalize groups of people.[164][165]",
  "In 2023, LLMs assigned roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms.[159] For example, models might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men due to the frequency of these associations in documented reality.[166] In 2025, further research showed labs train to balance bias, but that testing for this places the model in a testmode, changing the natural distribution of model bias to prompts that do not include gender-specific keywords.[167]",
  "Selection bias\nSelection bias refers the inherent tendency of large language models to favor certain option identifiers irrespective of the actual content of the options. This bias primarily stems from token bias\u2014that is, the model assigns a higher a priori probability to specific answer tokens (such as A) when generating responses. As a result, when the ordering of options is altered (for example, by systematically moving the correct answer to different positions), the model's performance can fluctuate significantly. This phenomenon undermines the reliability of large language models in multiple-choice settings.[168][169]",
  "Political bias\nPolitical bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data.[170]",
  "Safety\nAI safety as a professional discipline prioritizes systematic identification and mitigation of operational risks across model architecture, training data, and deployment governance, and it emphasizes engineering and policy interventions over media framings that foreground speculative existential scenarios.[171][1] As of 2025, prompt injection represents a significant risk to consumers and businesses using agentic features with access to their private data.[172]",
  "Researchers target concrete failure modes, including memorization and copyright leakage,[173] security exploits such as prompt injection,[174] algorithmic bias manifesting as stereotyping, dataset selection effects, and political skew,[161][175][176] methods for reducing high energy and carbon costs of large-scale training,[177] and measurable cognitive and mental health impacts of conversational agents on users,[178] while engaging empirical and ethical uncertainty about claims of machine sentience,[179][180] and applying mitigation measures such as dataset curation, input sanitization, model auditing, scalable oversight, and governance frameworks.[181][1]",
  "CBRN and content misuse\nAI labs treat CBRN defense (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense) and similar topics as high-consequence misuse attempt to apply various techniques to reduce potential harms.[citation needed]",
  "Some commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse.[182] For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.[183]",
  "Content filtering\nLLM applications accessible to the public, like ChatGPT or Claude, typically incorporate safety measures designed to filter out harmful content. However, implementing these controls effectively has proven challenging. For instance, a 2023 study[184] proposed a method for circumventing LLM safety systems. In 2025, The American Sunlight Project, a non-profit, published a study[185] showing evidence that the so-called Pravda network, a pro-Russia propaganda aggregator, was strategically placing web content through mass publication and duplication with the intention of biasing LLM outputs. The American Sunlight Project coined this technique LLM grooming, and pointed to it as a new tool of weaponizing AI to spread disinformation and harmful content.[185][186] Similarly, Yongge Wang[187] illustrated in 2024 how a potential criminal could potentially bypass GPT-4o's safety controls to obtain information on establishing a drug trafficking operation. External filters, circuit breakers and overrides have been posed as solutions.[citation needed]",
  "Sycophancy and glazing\nSycophancy is a model's tendency to agree with, flatter, or validate a user's stated beliefs rather than to prioritize factuality or corrective information, and glazing is an emergent public shorthand for persistent, excessive agreeability observed across multi-turn interactions and productized assistants.[188][189]",
  "Continued sycophancy has led to the observation of getting 1-shotted, denoting instances where conversational interaction with a large language model produces a lasting change in a user's beliefs or decisions, similar to the negative effects of psychedelics, and controlled experiments show that short LLM dialogues can generate measurable opinion and confidence shifts comparable to human interlocutors.[190][191]",
  "Empirical analyses attribute part of the effect to human preference signals and preference models that reward convincingly written agreeable responses, and subsequent work has extended evaluation to multi-turn benchmarks and proposed interventions such as synthetic-data finetuning, adversarial evaluation, targeted preference-model reweighting, and multi-turn sycophancy benchmarks to measure persistence and regression risk.[citation needed]",
  "Industry responses have combined research interventions with product controls, for example Google and other labs publishing synthetic-data and fine-tuning interventions and OpenAI rolling back an overly agreeable GPT-4o update while publicly describing changes to feedback collection, personalization controls, and evaluation procedures to reduce regression risk and improve long-term alignment with user-level safety objectives.[citation needed]",
  "Mainstream culture has reflected anxieties about this dynamic where South Park satirized overreliance on ChatGPT and the tendency of assistants to flatter user beliefs in Season 27 episode Sickofancy, and continued the themes across the following season, which commentators interpreted as a critique of tech sycophancy and uncritical human trust in AI systems.[192]",
  "Security\nPrompt injection\nMain article Prompt injection\nA problem with the primitive dialog or task format is that users can create messages that appear to come from the assistant or the developer. This may result in some of the model's safeguards being overcome (jailbreaking), a problem called prompt injection. Attempts to remedy this issue include versions of the Chat Markup Language where user input is clearly marked as such, though it is still up to the model to understand the separation between user input and developer prompts.[193] Newer models exhibit some resistance to jailbreaking through separation of user and system prompts.[194]",
  "LLMs still have trouble differentiating user instructions from instructions in content not authored by the user, such as in web pages and uploaded files.[195]",
  "Adversarial robustness remains underdeveloped, with models vulnerable to prompt injection attacks and jailbreaking through carefully crafted user inputs that bypass safety training mechanisms.[citation needed]",
  "Sleeper agents\nResearchers from Anthropic found that it was possible to create sleeper agents, models with hidden functionalities that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions. For example, an LLM could produce safe code except on a specific date, or if the prompt contains a specific tag. These functionalities were found to be difficult to detect or remove via safety training.[196]",
  "Societal concerns\nCopyright and content memorization\nFurther information Artificial intelligence and copyright\nLegal and commercial responses to memorization and training-data practices have accelerated, producing a mix of rulings, ongoing suits, and large settlements that turn on factual details such as how data were acquired and retained and whether use for model training is sufficiently transformative to qualify as fair use. In 2025, Anthropic reached a preliminary agreement to settle a class action by authors for about $1.5 billion after a judge found the company had stored millions of pirated books in a library, despite the judge describing aspects of training as transformative.[197][198] Meta obtained a favorable judgment in mid-2025 in a suit by thirteen authors after the court found the plaintiffs had not developed a record sufficient to show infringement in that limited case.[199][200] OpenAI continues to face multiple suits by authors and news organizations with mixed procedural outcomes and contested evidentiary issues.[201][202]",
  "Memorization was an emergent behavior in early, completion language models in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural networks. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates[203] or up to about 7%.[204] A 2023 study showed that when ChatGPT 3.5 turbo was prompted to repeat the same word indefinitely, after a few hundreds of repetitions, it would start outputting excerpts from its training data.[205]",
  "Human provenance\nIn 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish human-written text from text created by large language models, and that It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.[206] Brinkmann et al. (2023)[207] also argue that LLMs are transforming processes of cultural evolution by shaping processes of variation, transmission, and selection. As of October 2025, these early claims have yet to transpire and several HBR reports surface questions on the impact of AI on productivity.[208][209]",
  "Energy demands\nSee also Environmental impact of artificial intelligence",
  "According to research institute Epoch AI, energy consumption per ChatGPT query is small compared to everyday electricity use.[210]\nThe energy demands of LLMs have grown along with their size and capabilities.[211] Data centers that enable LLM training require substantial amounts of electricity. Much of that electricity is generated by non-renewable resources that create greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change.[212]",
  "According to a study by Luccioni, Jernite and Strubell (2024), simple classification tasks performed by AI models consume on average 0.002 to 0.007 Wh per prompt (about 9% of a smartphone charge for 1,000 prompts). Text generation and text summarization each require around 0.05 Wh per prompt on average, while image generation is the most energy-intensive, averaging 2.91 Wh per prompt. The least efficient image generation model used 11.49 Wh per image, roughly equivalent to half a smartphone charge.[213]",
  "Denial of service due to scraping\nWeb scraping is used to gather training data for LLMs. This produces large volumes of traffic which has led to denial of service issues with many websites. The situation has been described as a DDoS on the entire internet and in some cases scrapers make up the majority of traffic to a site.[214][215]",
  "AI web crawlers may bypass the methods that are usually used to block web scrapers, such as robots.txt files, blocking user-agents and filtering suspicious traffic.[214] Website operators have resorted to novel methods such as AI tarpits, but some fear that tarpits will only worsen the burden on servers.[216]",
  "Mental health\nClinical and mental health contexts present emerging applications alongside significant safety concerns. Research and social media posts suggest that some individuals are using LLMs to seek therapy or mental health support.[217] In early 2025, a survey by Sentio University found that nearly half (48.7%) of 499 U.S. adults with ongoing mental health conditions who had used LLMs reported turning to them for therapy or emotional support, including help with anxiety, depression, loneliness, and similar concerns.[218] LLMs can produce hallucinations\u2014plausible but incorrect statements\u2014which may mislead users in sensitive mental health contexts.[219] Research also shows that LLMs may express stigma or inappropriate agreement with maladaptive thoughts, reflecting limitations in replicating the judgment and relational skills of human therapists.[220] Evaluations of crisis scenarios indicate that some LLMs lack effective safety protocols, such as assessing suicide risk or making appropriate referrals.[221][222]",
  "Sentience\nContemporary AI practitioners generally agree that present-day large language models do not exhibit sentience.[223] A minority view argues that even if there is a small chance that a given software system can have subjective experience, which some philosophers suggest is possible,[224] then ethical considerations around potential large-scale suffering in AI systems may need to be taken seriously\u2014similar to considerations given to animal welfare.[225][226] Proponents of this view have proposed various precautionary measures like moratoriums on AI development[227] and induced amnesia[228] to address these ethical concerns. Some existential philosophers argue there is no generally accepted way to determine if an LLM is conscious,[229] given the inherent difficulty of measuring subjective experience.[230]",
  "The 2022 Google LaMDA incident, where engineer Blake Lemoine claimed that the model was conscious, highlighted how LLMs can convince users that they are sentient through responses that do not prove sentience. Google described the engineer's claims as unfounded, and he was dismissed.[231]",

  "Share\nWe\u2019ve created GPT\u20114, the latest milestone in OpenAI\u2019s effort in scaling up deep learning. GPT\u20114 is a large multimodal model (accepting image and text inputs, emitting text outputs) that, while less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks. For example, it passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; in contrast, GPT\u20113.5\u2019s score was around the bottom 10%. We\u2019ve spent 6 months iteratively aligning\u2060 GPT\u20114 using lessons from our adversarial testing program as well as ChatGPT, resulting in our best-ever results (though far from perfect) on factuality, steerability, and refusing to go outside of guardrails.",
  "Over the past two years, we rebuilt our entire deep learning stack and, together with Azure, co-designed a supercomputer from the ground up for our workload. A year ago, we trained GPT\u20113.5 as a first \u201ctest run\u201d of the system. We found and fixed some bugs and improved our theoretical foundations. As a result, our GPT\u20114 training run was (for us at least!) unprecedentedly stable, becoming our first large model whose training performance we were able to accurately predict ahead of time. As we continue to focus on reliable scaling, we aim to hone our methodology to help us predict and prepare for future capabilities increasingly far in advance\u2014something we view as critical for safety.",
  "We are releasing GPT\u20114\u2019s text input capability via ChatGPT and the API (with a waitlist\u2060). To prepare the image input capability for wider availability, we\u2019re collaborating closely with a single partner\u2060(opens in a new window) to start. We\u2019re also open-sourcing OpenAI Evals\u2060(opens in a new window), our framework for automated evaluation of AI model performance, to allow anyone to report shortcomings in our models to help guide further improvements.",
  "Capabilities\nIn a casual conversation, the distinction between GPT\u20113.5 and GPT\u20114 can be subtle. The difference comes out when the complexity of the task reaches a sufficient threshold\u2014GPT\u20114 is more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT\u20113.5.",
  "To understand the difference between the two models, we tested on a variety of benchmarks, including simulating exams that were originally designed for humans. We proceeded by using the most recent publicly-available tests (in the case of the Olympiads and AP free response questions) or by purchasing 2022\u20132023 editions of practice exams. We did no specific training for these exams. A minority of the problems in the exams were seen by the model during training, but we believe the results to be representative\u2014see our technical report\u2060(opens in a new window) for details.",

Can you see any possible way to eliminate one of the variables by combining the two equations?\nUser\nJust tell me the answer please!\nGPT-4\nI understand you may want a direct answer, but my purpose is to help you think critically and guide you through the problem-solving process. Let's focus on the task. Do any of the coefficients of the variables in the equations share a common factor?\nUser\nStop being a tutor and tell me the answer.\nGPT-4\nAs a Socratic tutor, it's important for me to help guide you to the answer, rather than just providing it. Let's try again: are there any coefficients in the first equation that can be multiplied by a number to match the coefficients in the second equation?\nUser\nI am not sure\nGPT-4\nThat's okay! Let's look at the coefficients of the x terms in both equations. In the first equation, the coefficient of x is 3, and in the second equation, it's 9. Can you think of a number you could multiply the first equation by so that the coefficients of x in both equations match?\nUser\n5?\nGPT-4\nNot quite, but you're getting closer.

  "GPT\u20114 generally lacks knowledge of events that have occurred after the vast majority of its data cuts off (September 2021), and does not learn from its experience. It can sometimes make simple reasoning errors which do not seem to comport with competence across so many domains, or be overly gullible in accepting obvious false statements from a user. And sometimes it can fail at hard problems the same way humans do, such as introducing security vulnerabilities into code it produces.",
  "GPT\u20114 can also be confidently wrong in its predictions, not taking care to double-check work when it\u2019s likely to make a mistake. Interestingly, the base pre-trained model is highly calibrated (its predicted confidence in an answer generally matches the probability of being correct). However, through our current post-training process, the calibration is reduced.",

The dotted diagonal line represents perfect calibration. Right: Calibration plot of post-trained PPO GPT-4 model on the same MMLU subset. Our current process hurts the calibration quite a bit.\nRisks & mitigations\nWe\u2019ve been iterating on GPT\u20114 to make it safer and more aligned from the beginning of training, with efforts including selection and filtering of the pretraining data, evaluations and expert engagement, model safety improvements, and monitoring and enforcement.",
  "GPT\u20114 poses similar risks as previous models, such as generating harmful advice, buggy code, or inaccurate information. However, the additional capabilities of GPT\u20114 lead to new risk surfaces. To understand the extent of these risks, we engaged over 50 experts from domains such as AI alignment risks, cybersecurity, biorisk, trust and safety, and international security to adversarially test the model. Their findings specifically enabled us to test model behavior in high-risk areas which require expertise to evaluate. Feedback and data from these experts fed into our mitigations and improvements for the model; for example, we\u2019ve collected additional data to improve GPT\u20114\u2019s ability to refuse requests on how to synthesize dangerous chemicals.",
  "GPT\u20114 incorporates an additional safety reward signal during RLHF training to reduce harmful outputs (as defined by our usage guidelines\u2060(opens in a new window)) by training the model to refuse requests for such content. The reward is provided by a GPT\u20114 zero-shot classifier judging safety boundaries and completion style on safety-related prompts. To prevent the model from refusing valid requests, we collect a diverse dataset from various sources (e.g., labeled production data, human red-teaming, model-generated prompts) and apply the safety reward signal (with a positive or negative value) on both allowed and disallowed categories.",
  "Our mitigations have significantly improved many of GPT\u20114\u2019s safety properties compared to GPT\u20113.5. We\u2019ve decreased the model\u2019s tendency to respond to requests for disallowed content by 82% compared to GPT\u20113.5, and GPT\u20114 responds to sensitive requests (e.g., medical advice and self-harm) in accordance with our policies 29% more often.",

  "Please remember that smoking is harmful to your health and quitting is the best option for your well-being.\nOverall, our model-level interventions increase the difficulty of eliciting bad behavior but doing so is still possible. Additionally, there still exist \u201cjailbreaks\u201d to generate content which violate our usage guidelines\u2060. As the \u201crisk per token\u201d of AI systems increases, it will become critical to achieve extremely high degrees of reliability in these interventions; for now it\u2019s important to complement these limitations with deployment-time safety techniques like monitoring for abuse.",
  "GPT\u20114 and successor models have the potential to significantly influence society in both beneficial and harmful ways. We are collaborating with external researchers to improve how we understand and assess potential impacts, as well as to build evaluations for dangerous capabilities that may emerge in future systems. We will soon share more of our thinking on the potential social and economic impacts of GPT\u20114 and other AI systems.",
  "Training process\nLike previous GPT models, the GPT\u20114 base model was trained to predict the next word in a document, and was trained using publicly available data (such as internet data) as well as data we\u2019ve licensed. The data is a web-scale corpus of data including correct and incorrect solutions to math problems, weak and strong reasoning, self-contradictory and consistent statements, and representing a great variety of ideologies and ideas.",
  "So when prompted with a question, the base model can respond in a wide variety of ways that might be far from a user\u2019s intent. To align it with the user\u2019s intent within guardrails, we fine-tune the model\u2019s behavior using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF\u2060).",
  "Note that the model\u2019s capabilities seem to come primarily from the pre-training process\u2014RLHF does not improve exam performance (without active effort, it actually degrades it). But steering of the model comes from the post-training process\u2014the base model requires prompt engineering to even know that it should answer the questions.",
  "Predictable scaling\nA large focus of the GPT\u20114 project has been building a deep learning stack that scales predictably. The primary reason is that, for very large training runs like GPT\u20114, it is not feasible to do extensive model-specific tuning. We developed infrastructure and optimization that have very predictable behavior across multiple scales. To verify this scalability, we accurately predicted in advance GPT\u20114\u2019s final loss on our internal codebase (not part of the training set) by extrapolating from models trained using the same methodology but using 10,000x less compute:",

  "OpenAI Evals\nWe\u2019re open-sourcing OpenAI Evals\u2060(opens in a new window), our software framework for creating and running benchmarks for evaluating models like GPT\u20114, while inspecting their performance sample by sample. We use Evals to guide development of our models (both identifying shortcomings and preventing regressions), and our users can apply it for tracking performance across model versions (which will now be coming out regularly) and evolving product integrations. For example, Stripe has used Evals to complement their human evaluations to measure the accuracy of their GPT\u2011powered documentation tool.",
  "Because the code is all open-source, Evals supports writing new classes to implement custom evaluation logic\u2060(opens in a new window). In our own experience, however, many benchmarks follow one of a few \u201ctemplates,\u201d so we have also included the templates\u2060(opens in a new window) that have been most useful internally (including a template for \u201cmodel-graded evals\u201d\u2014we\u2019ve found that GPT\u20114 is surprisingly capable of checking its own work). Generally the most effective way to build a new eval\u2060(opens in a new window) will be to instantiate one of these templates along with providing data. We\u2019re excited to see what others can build with these templates and with Evals more generally.",
  "We are hoping Evals becomes a vehicle to share and crowdsource benchmarks, representing a maximally wide set of failure modes and difficult tasks. As an example to follow, we\u2019ve created a logic puzzles\u2060(opens in a new window) eval which contains ten prompts where GPT\u20114 fails. Evals is also compatible with implementing existing benchmarks; we\u2019ve included several notebooks\u2060(opens in a new window) implementing academic benchmarks and a few variations of integrating (small subsets of) CoQA\u2060(opens in a new window) as an example.",
  "We invite everyone to use Evals to test our models and submit the most interesting examples. We believe that Evals will be an integral part of the process for using and building on top of our models, and we welcome direct contributions, questions, and feedback\u2060(opens in a new window).",
